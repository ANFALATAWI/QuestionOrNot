Commander is a song performed by American recording artist Kelly Rowland from her third studio album Here I Am 2011,S
It was cowritten by American songwriter Rico Love who described the song as a fun and aggressive club record with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors,S
Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production When Love Takes Over in 2009,S
The media reported that Knowles decision to release one more video Why Dont You Love Me from her album I Am Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released Commander was unfair on Rowland,S
The lyrics have themes around hair fashion and competing with other women,S
The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hiphop producer Timbaland,S
It felt good to have a song that I could express that in,S
Its important to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny,S
Love explained to RapUp magazine his view of the song Its just such an aggressive record its a club record its a worldwide international record,S
Shes stretching her legs out and shes showing her true vocal ability shes like the queen of the night on this record,S
She said working with Guetta was amazing because it is effortless and she feels a great sense of chemistry when working with him,S
Rowland felt she was trying something different In this generation and this day and time no one is putting soul in dance music  no pop artist,S
I thought maybe that was something I could try,S
I just thought itd be so much fun to be a commander of course,S
Its just a statement for me definitely coming out on my own filling my space,S
You know the first time I heard it I went bananas,S
At Pat Fields Disco Party in New York she told Universal Music Group executives I know in my gut that it felt good,S
Nobody could take my thoughts away from that,S
The song was released on May 17 and May 18 to the iTunes Store in France and the US respectively,S
The official Extended Dance Remix was released alongside the main single on May 18 2010,S
Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower smoother sound,S
The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19 2010 confirmed that Commander would serve only as the international lead single leading to speculation another song would be released domestically,S
This speculation was confirmed when the NeYopenned Shake Them Haters Off was set to impact on radio stations in the United States,S
However those plans were changed and on June 29 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in the United States,S
Robert Daw of Idolator said if you think Ms Kelly is taking the gogo boots off anytime soon then youd best go lean against the wall flower,S
Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian said that before Guettas collaborations with Kelis Acapella and Rowland she felt Guetta was ruining RB by turning all of my favorite ladies into Euro cheesemongers,S
The song mentions hair and being better than the other ladies,S
awarded it one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo  because of the chorus which rules,S
Entertainment Weekly named it the number one summer jam of the year whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24 2010,S
With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power Commander is proof that Kelly means business,S
His work is known for its scale impact and colorful imagery,S

Vladimir Gershonovich Drinfeld  Volodymyr Hershonovych Drinfeld born February 14 1954 is a Ukrainian mathematician currently working at the University of Chicago,S
Later in 1983 Drinfeld published a short article that expanded the scope of the Langlands conjectures,S
The Langlands conjectures when published in 1967 could be seen as a sort of nonabelian class field theory,S
It postulated the existence of a natural onetoone correspondence between Galois representations and some automorphic forms,S
The naturalness is guaranteed by the essential coincidence of Lfunctions,S
However this condition is purely arithmetic and cannot be considered for a general onedimensional function field in a straightforward way,S
Drinfeld pointed out that instead of automorphic forms one can consider automorphic perverse sheaves or automorphic Dmodules,S
Automorphicity of these modules and the Langlands correspondence could be then understood in terms of the action of Hecke operators,S
In collaboration with his advisor Yuri Manin he constructed the moduli space of YangMills instantons a result which was proved independently by Michael Atiyah and Nigel Hitchin,S
He also generalized Hopf algebras to quasiHopf algebras and introduced the study of Drinfeld twists which can be used to factorize the Rmatrix corresponding to the solution of the YangBaxter equation associated with a quasitriangular Hopf algebra,S
Drinfeld has also collaborated with Alexander Beilinson to rebuild the theory of vertex algebras in a coordinatefree form which have become increasingly important to conformal field theory string theory and the geometric Langlands program,S

An interview with Simon Singh for the Guardian in which Borcherds suggested he might have some traits associated with Asperger syndrome subsequently led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by Simon BaronCohen,S
BaronCohen concluded that while Borcherds had many autistic traits he did not merit a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome,S
Borcherds is best known for his work connecting the theory of finite groups with other areas in mathematics,S
In particular he invented the notion of vertex algebras which Igor Frenkel James Lepowsky and Arne Meurman used to construct an infinitedimensional graded algebra acted on by the monster group,S
Borcherds then used this and methods from string theory to prove the monstrous moonshine conjecture by Conway and Norton relating the monster group to the coefficients of the qexpansion of the jinvariant,S
The result was not only a great increase in understanding of the monster group a very large finite simple group whose structure was previously not well understood but tied the monster to various aspects of mathematics and mathematical physics,S

Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can live in both plants and animals,S
Its teleomorph is Filobasidiella neoformans a filamentous fungus belonging to the class Tremellomycetes,S
A third variety C n v gattii is now considered a distinct species Cryptococcus gattii,S
C n v grubii and C n v neoformans have a worldwide distribution and are often found in soil contaminated by bird excrement,S
The genome sequence of C neoformans v neoformans was published in 2005,S
When grown as a yeast C neoformans has a prominent capsule composed mostly of polysaccharides,S
Under the microscope the India ink stain is used for easy visualization of the capsule in cerebral spinal fluid,S
The particles of ink pigment do not enter the capsule that surrounds the spherical yeast cell resulting in a zone of clearance or halo around the cells,S
This allows for quick and easy identification of C neoformans,S
Most infections with C neoformans occur in the lungs,S
However fungal meningitis and encephalitis especially as a secondary infection for AIDS patients are often caused by C neoformans making it a particularly dangerous fungus,S
Infections with this fungus are rare in those with fully functioning immune systems,S
So C neoformans is sometimes referred to as an opportunistic fungus,S
Cryptococcal meningitis should be treated for two weeks with intrathecal amphotericin B 0710 mgkgday and oral flucytosine 100 mgkgday or intravenous flucytosine 75 mgkgday if the patient is unable to swallow,S
Intravenous ambisome 4 mgkgday may be used but is not superior its main use is in patients who do not tolerate amphotericin B,S
The dose of 200 mgkgday for flucytosine is not more effective is associated with more side effects and should not be used,S
In Africa oral fluconazole at a rate of 200 mg daily is often used,S
However this does not result in cure because it merely suppresses the fungus and does not kill it viable fungus can continue to be grown from cerebrospinal fluid of patients not having taken fluconazole for many months,S
An increased dose of 400 mg daily does not improve outcomes but prospective studies from Uganda and Malawi reported that higher doses of 1200 mg per day have more fungicidal activity,S

The Battle of Concepción was fought on October 28 1835 between Mexican troops under Colonel Domingo Ugartechea and Texian insurgents led by James Bowie and James Fannin,S
The 30minute engagement which historian JR Edmondson describes as the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution occurred on the grounds of Mission Concepción south of what is now Downtown San Antonio in the US state of Texas,S
On October 13 the newly created Texian Army under Stephen F Austin had marched towards Bexar where General Martín Perfecto de Cos commanded the remaining Mexican soldiers in the Texas,S
On October 27 Austin sent Bowie and Fannin with 90 soldiers to find a defensible spot near Bexar for the Texian Army to rest,S
After choosing a site near Mission Concepción the scouting party camped for the night and sent a courier to notify Austin,S
After learning that the Texian Army was divided Cos sent Ugartechea with 275 soldiers to attack the Texians camped at Concepción,S
Historians estimate that between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed while only one Texian soldier died,S
Days earlier General Martín Perfecto de Cos brotherinlaw of Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna had arrived in Bexar to take command of all the Mexican forces in Texas,S
By October 20 the Texiansled by Stephen F Austin the first empresario to bring Englishspeaking settlers to Texashad reached Salado Creek and initiated a siege of Bexar,S
Despite those efforts several people were able to leave their homes and join the Texians,S
Among those was James Bowie who was well known for his fighting prowess stories of his exploits in the Sandbar Fight and his search for the lost San Saba mine had been widely reported,S
On October 22 Austin named Bowie a colonel and gave him joint command of the 1st Battalion with Captain James W Fannin,S
After investigating three of the missions Bowie and Fannin selected Mission San Francisco de la Espada as the most promising campsite,S
The rest of the Texian Army joined them there early on October 27,S
Eager to move closer to Bexar Austin immediately sent Bowie and Fannin to find a good defensive spot for the army to rest that night,S
The group took a northerly route following the San Antonio River past Missions San Juan and San José,S
Along the way they encountered a small party of Mexican scouts who retreated to Bexar after a brief skirmish,S
Five hundred yards 460 m west of the mission the San Antonio River curved in a small horseshoe shape with the two sides of the rivers curve approximately apart,S
According to historian Alwyn Barr trees shaded both sides of the broad riverbottom which lay about six feet below the level of the rolling praire nearby,S
Rather than return immediately to Austin as their orders specified Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to bring Austin directions to Concepción,S
The next day an angry Austin issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with courtmartial,S
The Texian scouting party divided into two camps,S
Fannin supervised 49 men at the south part of the horseshoe bend while Bowie and the remaining men camped at the northern part of the bend,S
Any Mexican force coming from the north would be caught in their crossfire,S
Pickets were stationed around the area and in the mission tower which offered greater visibility,S
As they settled down for the evening the Texians were surprised to see a Mexican cannonball fired from one of the church towers in Bexar hit just beyond their camp,S
Many of the Texian soldiers believed that a priest from the mission had informed the Mexican Army of their position,S
At 600 am Ugartechea left Bexar with 275 Mexican soldiers and 2 cannon,S
As the remaining Texian sentries hurried to join the main body of Texian soldiers Pen Jarvis was struck by a Mexican bullet and fell down the river bank,S
The bullet hit a knife Jarvis had slipped through the front of his belt and he suffered only bruises,S
The Texian position was surrounded by trees leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver,S
The 200 members of the cavalry remained on the west bank of the river behind the Texians to foil any escape attempts,S
Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians,S
In response Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire,S
The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours until the fog began to lift,S
At that point 5060 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians,S
Seeing their approach Bowie shouted to his Texian forces Keep under cover boys and reserve your fire we havent a man to spare,S
At from the Texian position the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle,S
They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions to little effect,S
For the most part the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians,S
In his official report to Austin Bowie remarked that The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire whilst that from our lines was more slowly delivered but with good aim and deadly effect,S
The Texians were short of ammunition however and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful it was poor quality,S
In several cases Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers causing little damage other than a bruise,S
When Mexican officers ordered a charge on the south bend held by Fannin Bowie sent Colemans company to help,S
Most of the Texian reinforcements maneuvered to their new position from below the river bank but several rose from cover and dashed across the prairie,S
One of them Richard Andrews was hit in the side with grapeshot and died several hours after the battle,S
As the reinforcements reached the southern part of the horseshoe the Mexican infantry fell back leaving the cannon within of the Texians,S
After three different sets of gunners were killed or wounded the cannons were abandoned,S
The Mexican infantry attempted three attacks all were repulsed,S
As the Mexican buglers called for a retreat the infantry fell back beyond Texian rifle range,S
The Mexican cavalry was sent to retrieve wounded men and the cannon,S
As the cavalry approached Bowie led a charge onto the prairie,S
The Texians quickly captured the cannon and turned it on the fleeing Mexican soldiers,S
Grapeshot killed one of the mule drivers causing his caisson to go out of control and careen through the shattered Mexican ranks,S
The battle had lasted only 30 minutes,S
Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis and his company of cavalry rode ahead of the main body of the army,S
When they reached Concepción the Mexican Army was still visible in the distance,S
Less than 30 minutes after the battle ended the rest of the Texian Army arrived,S
Austin felt that the Mexican morale must be low after their defeat and wanted to proceed immediately to Bexar,S
Bowie and other officers refused as they believed Bexar was too heavily fortified,S
The Texians searched the area for any Mexican equipment which had been abandoned during the retreat,S
They found several boxes of cartridges,S
Complaining that the Mexican powder was little better than pounded charcoal the Texians emptied the cartridges but kept the bullets,S
That evening Austin allowed a local priest and men from Bexar to retrieve the bodies of the Mexican soldiers who had died in battle,S
Barr estimated that at least 14 Mexican soldiers were killed with an additional 39 wounded several of whom died later,S
Timothy Todish et al in their book The Alamo Sourcebook estimated that 60 Mexican soldiers were killed while historian Stephen Hardin claimed that 76 Mexican soldiers died,S
The only Texian to die in battle was Andrews and Jarvis was the only Texian classified as wounded,S
This battle which historian JR Edmondson describes as the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution was the last offensive against the Texians that Cos would order,S
Barr attributed the Texian victory to able leadership a strong position and greater firepower,S
The Mexican cavalry was unable to fight effectively in the wooded riverbottom terrain and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had a much lower range than that of the Texians,S
The Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army,S
The battle took place on November 26 1835 just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas,S
The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texians had initiated a siege of Béxar home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province,S
Bored with the inactivity many of the Texian soldiers returned home a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them,S
After the Texian Army rejected commanderinchief Stephen F Austins call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22 Austin resigned from the army,S
The men elected Edward Burleson their new commanderinchief,S
After the battle ended disgruntled colonists continued to assemble in Gonzales eager to put a decisive end to Mexican control over the area,S
On October 11 the disorganized volunteers elected Stephen F Austin who had settled the first Englishspeaking colonists in Texas as their commanderinchief,S
Several days later Austin marched his newly created Texian Army towards San Antonio de Béxar where General Martín Perfecto de Cos brotherinlaw of Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna oversaw the garrison at the Alamo,S
In late October the Texians initiated a siege of Béxar,S
Battle  grass fight At 1000 am on November 26 Texian scout Erastus Deaf Smith rode into camp to report that a pack train of mules and horses accompanied by 50100 Mexican soldiers was within of Béxar,S
For several days the Texians had heard rumors that the Mexican Army was expecting a shipment of silver and gold to pay the troops and purchase additional supplies,S
The Texians had been fighting without pay and most wanted to charge from camp and loot the expected riches,S
Burleson calmed the crowd and then ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 3540 mounted men to investigate but only attack if necessary,S
After Bowie recruited the armys 12 best marksmen for the expedition there was little doubt that he intended to find a reason to attack,S
Burleson managed to stop the entire army from following by sending Colonel William Jack with 100 infantry to support Bowies men,S
The Mexican forces counterattacked but were repulsed,S
The lack of noise made it difficult for them to ascertain where the Mexican troops were and the Texians were surprised to find themselves between the Mexican cavalry and infantry,S
As the Mexican troops began firing the Texian infantry troops dropped to the ground,S
Colonel Thomas Rusk led a group of 15 in an attack on the nearest Mexican cavalry as those cavalrymen fled the Texian infantry was able to scramble to cover,S
The Mexican artillery fired three times driving the Texians back,S
Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to take a small rise to give the artillery better position they were repulsed,S
Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men preserving  strict order and exhibiting no confusion,S
The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry to try to take the Mexican cannon,S
In his reports Burleson claimed that 15 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 7 wounded while Bowie claimed that 60 Mexican soldiers had been killed,S
In his book Texans in Revolt the Battle for San Antonio 1835 historian Alwyn Barr stated that only 3 Mexican soldiers had been killed and 14 wounded most of the casualties were from the cavalry companies,S
Burleson praised all of his officers for their conduct Bowie received the most mention,S
The Texians captured 40 horses and mules,S
To their surprise the saddlebags did not contain bullion,S
Instead the mules had been carrying freshly cut grass to feed the Mexican horses trapped in Béxar this prize gave the battle its name,S
Although the engagement which historian J R Edmondson termed a ludicrous affair did not yield valuable plunder it did serve to unite the Texian Army,S
Days before the army had been bitterly divided and unwilling to risk a prolonged siege or assault,S
With their success at the Grass Fight however the Texian soldiers began to believe that although outnumbered they could prevail over the Béxar garrison,S
The Texians believed that Cos must have been desperate to send troops outside of the safety of Béxar,S
Several days later on December 1 a handful of Americans in Béxar convinced Cos to allow them free passage from the city,S
Although they had promised to leave the country the men including Samuel Maverick instead joined the Texian Army and provided information about the Mexican defenses and the low morale within the town,S
Buoyed by their Grass Fight victory on December 5 the Texians launched an attack on Béxar Cos surrendered on December 9,S
As a condition of their parole the Mexican troops were forced to leave the province leaving the Texas colonists in full control,S
Unbeknownst to the Texians on February 18 Mexican General José de Urrea led a large contingent of troops from Matamoros into Texas,S
After a brief battle the main body of the Texian and Tejano troops were defeated,S
Grant was killed as were 11 other men under his command,S
Six Texians were taken prisoner contrary to Santa Annas orders Urrea did not execute the prisoners but instead sent them to a jail in Matamoros,S
An additional six Texians escaped five of them later died in the Goliad Massacre,S
By the end of 1835 all of the Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas,S
Members of the General Council the interim Texas governing body were enamored with the idea of a Matamoros Expedition,S
The provisional governor Henry Smith was opposed to the Matamoros Expedition and ordered Houston to find a way to disband it,S
The rest of the men remained with Grant ostensibly to look for more horses,S
Mexican troops arrived in San Patricio in the early hours of February 26,S
Unaware of Johnsons fate on February 27 Grant and his party began their march northward to San Patricio driving a herd of several hundred horses he had purchased,S
Approximately south of San Patricio about from Banquete and just north of modernday Kingsville Mexican soldiers took cover in two groves of trees,S
Grant Benavides and Ruben Brown rode ahead of the main body of Texians and saw no signs of the Mexican soldiers,S
Between 10 and 11 am as the bulk of the Texians reached the trees the Mexican cavalry attacked,S
Taken completely unaware many of the Texians were shot before they were able to raise their guns,S
Once in the melee Brown dismounted either to reload his rifle or because his horse was killed,S
According to Browns later recollection both his and Grants horses were wounded as Mexican soldiers fired after them,S
Grant and Brown were surrounded and forced to stop,S
Grant killed a Mexican soldier who drove a lance through Browns arm,S
This made him the target of the other soldiers and he died after being pierced multiple times,S
Brown was then brought back to the site of the ambush,S
The men were escorted to a prison in Matamoros,S
Five of these joined Fannins garrison at Goliad and were later killed in the Goliad Massacre,S
No reports of Mexican losses have been found although at least one Mexican soldier is thought to have died,S
After the battle Mexican soldiers rounded up the horses that the Texians had been herding and kept them,S
According to historian Stephen Hardin this battle proved that the Texians did not fight well on open prairies,S
News of the imminent arrival of Urrea worried Fannin who feared that Santa Anna would lead his troops from San Antonio de Béxar towards Goliad essentially trapping Fannin and his men between the two branches of the Mexican Army,S
Fannin wrote to the Acting Governor James Robinson I am a better judge of my military abilities than others and if I am qualified to command an Army I have not found it out,S
The battle of San Patricio fought on February 27 1836 was the first military action of the Goliad Campaign during the Texas Revolution,S
Seán Baptist Brady 16 August 1939 is an Irish cardinal of the Catholic Church,S
The Battle of Coleto also known as the Battle of Coleto Creek the Battle of the Prairie and the Batalla del encinal del Perdido was fought on March 19 201836 during the Goliad campaign of the Texas Revolution,S
In February General José de Urrea led a branch of the Mexican army up the Gulf Coast of Mexican Texas toward Goliad where a large contingent of soldiers from the Texian Army were garrisoned under Colonel James W Fannin,S
Simultaneously Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led a larger force into the Texan interior where on March 6 his troops won the Battle of the Alamo,S
After learning of the Alamos defeat Texan general Sam Houston ordered Fannin to retreat from Goliad and join the rest of the army in Victoria,S
On March 19 Fannin led his men on a leisurely retreat from Goliad,S
Mexican troops surrounded the Texians later in the day before Fannin could reach the shelter of a grove of timber at Coleto Creek some away,S
Texans formed a square in the middle of the prairie and attempted to defend their position,S
Although Mexican troops launched three separate attacks against the square they could not penetrate the Texian position,S
As night fell Mexican sharpshooters were able to wound and kill more Texans,S
With little water to give to the wounded or to cool their artillery the Texians felt they were unable to withstand further fighting,S
On the morning of March 20 the Texians surrendered,S
Urrea attempted to secure honorable terms for his Texan prisoners,S
However Santa Anna had received authorization from the Mexican Congress to treat all captured Texian troops as pirates rather than prisonersofwar,S
Against Urreas pleadings all of the Texians were sentenced to death,S
A few Texians escaped the Goliad Massacre on March 27 but most were killed,S
After the Alamo fell to Santa Annas forces the Texians received orders from General Sam Houston to fall back to Victoria,S
Fannin therefore abandoned the fort but proceeded without adequate supplies and without haste on his retreat,S
The Texan force included the San Antonio Greys the Red Rovers the Mustangs commanded by Burr H Duval a militia from Refugio commanded by Hugh McDonald Frazer Texan regular soldiers commanded by Ira Westover and the Mobile Greys,S
Nine heavy artillery pieces with different calibers were ordered by Fannin to be taken by the Texans along with 1000 muskets but he neglected to ensure that a good amount of food and water was transported,S
Carts loaded with heavy equipment were being pulled by hungry and tired oxen,S
Urrea did not realize the Texians had left until 1100,S
John Shackelford Burr H Duval and Ira Westover opposed Fannins decision to allow the oxen to graze arguing that they should continue their retreat until they reached the protection of the Coleto Creek timber,S
Shackelford would state that Fannin argued that the Mexican army against them was poor and that Urrea would not follow them,S
In an effort to catch Fannins troops Urrea left his artillery and some of his men in Goliad,S
He began his pursuit with according to Mexican sources 80 cavalrymen and 360 infantrymen,S
Mexican mounted scouts determined the location of the Texans and reported the size of the force which Urrea concluded was smaller than he originally thought,S
As a result he ordered 100 of his soldiers to go back to Goliad to help secure Presidio La Bahía,S
He also ordered the artillery he left in Goliad to be brought to him and that the artillery would be escorted by some of the soldiers he was sending back,S
Meanwhile Albert C Hortons 30 cavalrymen were serving as advance guards and were positioned to cover all sides of the Texan force,S
Shortly after they resumed their march another Texan cart broke down and its cargo had to be transferred to another one delaying the retreat again,S
Shortly after Fannin had sent Horton to scout the Coleto Creek timber that was in sight then the Mexican cavalry overtook Fannins Texians,S
As the Texans tried to get to high ground 400 to 500 yards away from the position they were in when the cavalry overtook them the ammunition cart broke,S
The high grass of the prairie meant the Texan view of the Mexicans was impaired,S
Each Texian soldier received three to four muskets,S
The square was three ranks deep,S
The front line contained the San Antonio Greys and Red Rovers whilst Duvals Mustangs and Frazers Refugio militia formed part of the rear line,S
The left flank was covered by Westovers regulars whilst the right was protected by the Mobile Greys,S
In the corners of the square the artillery had been positioned,S
Fannin stood in the rear of the right flank,S
In addition a number of sharpshooters were deployed around Abel Morgans hospital wagon which could no longer be moved after the ox that was moving it was killed by Mexican fire,S
The Mexican soldiers then attacked the square,S
The left of the Texian square was confronted by the rifle companies under Morales and the right was assaulted by the grenadiers and part of the San Luis Battalion,S
The Mexican formations involved in this attack on the right of the square was under the personal supervision of Urrea,S
By sunset when Urrea ordered the Mexicans to cease any more major attacks against the square due to a lack of Mexican ammunition the majority of the action of 19 March was over,S
The Mexicans had assaulted the square three times,S
Making effective use of their bayonets multiple muskets and nine cannons the Texians had prevented the Mexicans each time from breaking the square,S
Urrea said that he was impressed with the fact that the Texians had managed to maintain the square against the three charges and he was also impressed with the Texian weapon fire,S
Dr Joseph H Barnard a Texian recorded that by sunset seven Texians had been killed,S
He also recorded that sixty Texians including Fannin had been wounded,S
Forty of the sixty had been wounded several times,S
After sunset Urrea ordered Mexican sharpshooters to be positioned in the tall grass around the square and that they fire at the Texians,S
Before Texian sharpshooters were able to remove the threat posed by the Mexican sharpshooters by firing at the flash caused by the Mexican guns the Mexican sharpshooters were able to inflict more Texian casualties,S
As a result of all the fighting that occurred on 19 March the Texians had suffered at least ten dead and sixty wounded whilst the Mexicans suffered an unspecified high amount of casualties,S
The fighting of 19 March had not demoralised the Texian soldiers,S
They were encouraged by the thought that Horton would succeed in getting Texian reinforcements from Guadalupe Victoria to Fannin,S
However Horton had not been able to break through the Mexican defences,S
During the days fighting the Texian soldiers that were retreating to Guadalupe Victoria after the earlier battle of Refugio were close enough to Fannin to hear gunfire,S
However they were exhausted and hungry and did not move to the square,S
Urrea stationed three detachments of Mexican troops around the square to prevent the Texians in the square from escaping and during the night Mexican false bugle calls were sounded to keep the Texians alert,S
The Texians lack of water and the inability to light fires in the square meant the wounded Texians could not be treated,S
The pain being experienced by the wounded resulted in the general decrease in morale amongst the Texian soldiers during the night,S
The poor weather during the night further lessened the morale of the soldiers,S
The lack of water also meant that the artillery could not be used effectively the next day because water was needed to cool and clean the cannons,S
The fighting of 19 March had also left many Texian artillerists casualties and ammunition for the cannons was low,S
All these factors contributed to the conclusion by Fannin and other officers during the night that they could not sustain another day of fighting,S
It was therefore decided that the Texians should attempt to make another stand from their current position the next day,S
As a result during the night the Texians dug trenches and erected barricades of carts and dead animals,S
Urrea meanwhile had been reinforced with munitions fresh troops and two or three artillery pieces from Goliad,S
He positioned the Mexican artillery on the slopes overlooking the Texian square,S
At 0615 on March 20 the Mexicans were grouped for battle,S
After one or two rounds were fired by Mexican artillery Fannin and his officers reiterated their conclusion that the Texians could not take another days fighting and decided to seek honorable terms for surrender,S
As a result Urrea could not guarantee that all the terms would be followed by Santa Anna,S
He stated that he would talk to Santa Anna on behalf of the terms of surrender presented by the Texians,S
The document of surrender was signed by Benjamin C Wallace Joseph M Chadwick and Fannin,S
As a result of the signing the battle of Coleto ended,S
It would take until about March 23 until those Texans that could not walk were transported to Goliad,S
During that time Mexican physicians were told that wounded Mexicans were a priority to treat as opposed to the wounded Texans,S
Fannin arrived in Goliad on March 22,S
Urrea meanwhile had moved onto Guadalupe Victoria from where he wrote to Santa Anna a letter recommending that the Texan prisoners should be treated with clemency,S
However Santa Anna did not follow Urreas recommendation instead ordering the Mexican commander Jose Nicolas de la Portilla at Goliad to execute the Texan prisoners,S
On Palm Sunday March 27 1836 Fannin and about 340 other Texan prisoners were shot by Mexican soldiers,S
The execution became known as the Goliad Massacre,S
The Battle of Coleto was significant because it showed that Texan troops involved in the battle despite being relatively untrained were able to stand up to the Mexican troops against them and obey their commanders,S
The battle was primarily lost because Fannin did not act decisively enough to ensure success and he underestimated the quality of the Mexican force against him,S
It also illustrated that Fannin was reluctant to coordinate his actions with other Texan forces a trait that was common amongst many Texian commanders,S
The Battle of Refugio was fought from March 12151836 near Refugio Texas,S
The battle a part of the Goliad Campaign of the Texas Revolution resulted in a Mexican victory and splintered Texan resistance,S
To make matters worse Fannin learned that some colonists who supported the revolt were in danger from Urreas advance,S
King with a small force and wagons to collect families and escort them back to Goliad,S
March 11 was spent gathering families and loading carts for the return trip,S
However on the 12th King decided to confront the Centralista forces of Carlos de la Garza and the rancheros who rode with him,S
The opposition forces proved to be greater than imagined and King asked Fannin to send help,S
King and the Kentucky Mustangs took refuge in the old Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission at Refugio on March 12,S
Receiving word Fannin dispatched William Ward commanding a group from Peyton S Wyatt and the Georgia Battalion to assist King,S
Ward made his stand at the mission and a furious battle ensued,S
Although successful in breaking up the siege on the 13th the arrival of Ward at Refugio led to a conflict over command between the two officers,S
This dispute caused the insurgents to break into several smaller detachments,S
King left and ventured to attack a nearby ranch believed to be occupied by Centralistas killing 8,S
As more of Urreas troops arrived the fighting with Wards men continued,S
The groups held their own on the 14th repelling four assaults killing 80  100 Mexican troops and wounding 50,S
The Texians suffered light losses about 15 but were now short on ammunition and supplies,S
King returned from his raid in the evening but could not get to the mission for safety,S
They had to fight from a treeline across from it near the Mission River where they also inflicted heavy losses upon the Mexican army,S
Ward sent courier James Humphries to Fannin for orders,S
Edward Perry returned word from Fannin to fall back to Victoria where Texian forces were to later regroup,S
At night the groups attempted the escape,S
The wounded and a few others would remain behind,S
Their flight seemed successful at first but there were overwhelming numbers of Mexican troops in wait,S
Each group was subsequently defeated and its survivors captured by Urreas troops,S
They were returned as prisoners of war to the Refugio Mission,S
On March 16 fifteen men were executed King and the remnants of his company and several of Wards men,S

The library of Celsus is an ancient Roman building in Ephesus Anatolia now part of Selçuk Turkey,S
He was a native of nearby Sardis and amongst the earliest men of purely Greek origin to become a consul in the Roman Empire and is honoured both as a Greek and a Roman on the library itself,S
Celsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth,S
The library was built to store 12000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus,S
Celsus is buried in a sarcophagus beneath the library in the main entrance which is both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument to him,S
The building is important as one of the few remaining examples of an ancient Romaninfluenced library,S
About 400 AD the library was transformed into a Nymphaeum,S
The facade was completely destroyed by a later earthquake likely in the late Byzantine period,S
In a massive restoration which is considered to be very true to the historic building the front façade was rebuilt during the 1960s and 1970s and now serves as a prime example of Roman public architecture,S
Such libraries may also have housed collections of local documents of interest if the documents were not destroyed during the Roman conquest,S
The edifice is a single hall that faces east toward the morning sun as Vitruvius advised to benefit early risers,S
The library is built on a platform with nine steps the full width of the building leading up to three front entrances,S
The central entrance is larger than the two flanking ones and all are adorned with windows above,S
Flanking the entrances are four pairs of Composite columns elevated on pedestals,S
A set of Corinthian columns stands directly above the first set adding to the height of the building,S
The pairs of columns on the second level frame the windows as the columns on the first level frame the doors and also create niches that would have housed statues,S
It is thought there may have been a third set of columns but today there are only two registers of columns,S
This type of façade with inset frames and niches for statues is similar to that found in ancient Greek theatres the stage building behind the orchestra or skene and is thus characterised as scenographic,S
The buildings other sides are architecturally irrelevant as the library was flanked by buildings,S
The interior of the building not fully restored was a single rectangular room measuring 17x11 m with a central apse framed by a large arch at the far wall,S
A statue of Celsus or of Athena goddess of truth stood in the apse and Celsus tomb lay directly below in a vaulted chamber,S
Along the other three sides were rectangular recesses that held cupboards and shelves for the 12000 scrolls,S
Celsus was said to have left a legacy of 25000 denarii to pay for the librarys reading material,S
The second and third levels could be reached via a set of stairs built into the walls to add support to the building and had similar niches for scrolls,S
The ceiling was flat and there may have been a central square oculus to provide more light,S
The style of the library with its ornate balanced wellplanned façade reflects the Greek influence on Roman architecture,S
The building materials brick concrete and mortared rubble signify the new materials that came into use in the Roman Empire around the 2nd century AD,S
The buildings façade was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 20 million lira banknote of 20012005 and of the 20 new lira banknote of 20052009,S

The Gnostic term Barbēlō Greek Βαρβηλώ refers to the first emanation of God in several forms of Gnostic cosmogony,S
Barbēlō is often depicted as a supreme female principle the single passive antecedent of creation in its manifoldness,S
This figure is also variously referred to as MotherFather hinting at her apparent androgyny First Human Being The Triple Androgynous Name or Eternal Aeon,S
All subsequent acts of creation within the divine sphere save crucially that of the lowest aeon Sophia occurs through her coaction with God,S
116 121 the earth apparently is the matter of Barbēlō 128 or the place of Barbēlō 373,S
The first passage is in the article on the Nicolaitans i,S
77 f but is apparently an anticipatory reference to their alleged descendants the Gnostici 77 A Philast,S
She was always appearing to the Archons in a beautiful form that by beguiling them she might gather up her own scattered power,S
Others Epiphanius further seems to say 78 f told a similar tale of Prunikos substituting Caulacau for Yaldabaoth,S
In both places Epiphanius represents the doctrine as giving rise to sexual libertinism,S
Theodoret H F f 13 merely paraphrases Irenaeus with a few words from Epiphanius,S
Jerome several times includes Barbēlō in lists of portentous names current in Spanish heresy that is among Priscillianists Balsamus and Leusibora being three times associated with it Ep,S
75 c 3 p 453 c,S
p 393 A in Esai,S
4 p 361 c in Amos iii,S
The emanation of Barbēlō may be said to function as an intermediary generative aspect of the Divine or as an abstraction of the generative aspect of the Divine through its Fullness,S
The most transcendent hidden invisible Spirit is not depicted as actively participating in creation,S
This significance is reflected both in her apparent androgyny reinforced by several of her given epithets and in the name Barbēlō itself,S
Several plausible etymologies of the name Βαρβηλώ Βαρβηρώ Βαρβηλ Βαρβηλώθ have been proposed,S

The Hypostasis of the Archons or The Reality of the Rulers is an exegesis on the Book of Genesis 16 and expresses Gnostic mythology of the creations of the cosmos and humanity,S
It is tentatively dated in the third century CE and is thought to originate from a transitional period in Gnosticism when it was converting from a purely mythological state into a philosophical phase,S
The treatise begins with a fragment of cosmogony which leads to a revisionistic true history of the events in the Genesis creation story reflecting Gnostic distrust of the material world and the demiurge that created it,S

Conceived in 1937 the machine was not programmable being designed only to solve systems of linear equations,S
The ABC innovations included electronic computation binary arithmetic parallel processing regenerative capacitor memory and a separation of memory and computing functions,S
The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Atanasoff over the next year,S
A grant application to build a proof of concept prototype was submitted in March 1939 to the Agronomy department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis,S
5000 of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit Research Corporation of New York City,S
The ABC was built by Atanasoff and Berry in the basement of the physics building at Iowa State College during 193942,S
The initial funds were released in September and the 11tube prototype was first demonstrated in October 1939,S
A December demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the fullscale machine,S
The ABC was built and tested over the next two years,S
A January 15 1941 story in the Des Moines Register announced the ABC as an electrical computing machine with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would compute complicated algebraic equations but gave no precise technical description of the computer,S
The system weighed more than seven hundred pounds 320 kg,S
It contained approximately 1 mile 16 km of wire 280 dualtriode vacuum tubes 31 thyratrons and was about the size of a desk,S
Nor did it implement the stored program architecture that made practical fully generalpurpose reprogrammable computers,S
In addition the system pioneered the use of regenerative capacitor memory as in the DRAM still widely used today,S
The memory of the AtanasoffBerry Computer was a pair of drums each containing 1600 capacitors that rotated on a common shaft once per second,S
The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 bands of 50 30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed giving the machine a speed of 30 additionssubtractions per second,S
The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time 3000 bits,S
The alternating current power line frequency of 60 Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowestlevel operations,S
The arithmetic logic functions were fully electronic implemented with vacuum tubes,S
The family of logic gates ranged from inverters to two and three input gates,S
The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates,S
The control logic functions which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed were electromechanical implemented with relays,S
Although the AtanasoffBerry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem,S
An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions much like the electromechanical calculators and unit record equipment of the time,S
Selection of the operation to be performed reading writing converting to or from binary to decimal or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers,S
There were two forms of input and output primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input,S
The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory,S
The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two simultaneous equations a trivial problem,S
Intermediate results were binary written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50 bit numbers one equation,S
Each sheet could be written or read in one second,S
The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100000 calculations by these units primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets material characteristics,S
In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written,S
This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for warrelated work,S
Primary user input was decimal via standard IBM 80column punched cards and output was decimal via a front panel display,S
It could handle systems with up to twentynine equations a difficult problem for the time,S
Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics the department in which John Atanasoff worked,S
The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twentynine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables,S
This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable,S
Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable,S
George W Snedecor the head of Iowa States Statistics Department was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems,S
He submitted many of these problems to Atanasoff,S
The ABC had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941 and Isaac Auerbach a former student of Mauchlys alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC although Mauchly denied this Shurkin pg,S
The ENIAC patent did not issue until 1964 and by 1967 Honeywell sued Sperry Rand in an attempt to break the ENIAC patents arguing the ABC constituted prior art,S
The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota released its judgement on October 19 1973 finding in Honeywell v Sperry Rand that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoffs invention,S
CampbellKelly and Aspray concludeThe case was legally resolved on October 19 1973 when US District Judge Earl R Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the AtanasoffBerry Computer,S
Judge Larson explicitly statedReplicaThe original ABC was eventually dismantled when the University converted the basement to classrooms and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded,S
In 1997 a team of researchers led by John Gustafson from Ames Laboratory located on the Iowa State campus finished building a working replica of the AtanasoffBerry Computer at a cost of 350000,S
The replica ABC is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the Durham Center for Computation and Communication at Iowa State University,S
As of May 2012 it is on loan to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View California for a major exhibition,S

The St Louis franchise was surprising as no formal application from the city had been tendered,S
It was awarded to fulfill the wishes of James D Norris and Arthur Wirtz owners of the Chicago Black Hawks who also owned the St Louis Arena which they wanted to sell,S
On the debit side a strong bid from Vancouver was rejected much to the anger of many Canadians and the protest of their Prime Minister Lester Pearson,S
In the meantime however the career of future Hockey Hall of Famer Ted Lindsay was over as his request for reinstatement as an active player was vetoed by the Toronto ownership,S
Gordie Howe scored his 600th NHL goal in Montreal on November 27 in a 32 loss to the Canadiens to the cheers of the local fans,S

The Seals finished last in the West Division,S
Glenn Hall may have been deemed too old by the Black Hawks which left him unprotected in the expansion draft but not for the St Louis Blues who rode his five shutouts to a third place finish,S
A surprising benefit was their leading scorer previously unheralded Red Berenson with only 45 points in 185 previous NHL games who exploded into stardom more than doubling his career total in only 55 games,S

The land of Provence has a history quite separate from that of any of the larger nations of Europe,S
Its independent existence has its origins in the frontier nature of the dukedom in Merovingian Gaul,S
In this position influenced and affected by several different cultures on different sides the Provençals maintained a unity which was reinforced when it was created a separate kingdom in the Carolingian decline of the later ninth century,S
Provence was eventually joined to the other Burgundian kingdom but it remained ruled by its own powerful and largely independent counts,S
In the eleventh century Provence became disputed between the traditional line and the counts of Toulouse who claimed the title of Margrave of Provence,S
In the High Middle Ages the title of Count of Provence belonged to local families of Frankish origin to the House of Barcelona to the House of Anjou and to a cadet branch of the House of Valois,S
After 1032 the county was part of the Holy Roman Empire,S
It was inherited by King Louis XI of France in 1481 and definitively incorporated into the French royal domain by his son Charles VIII in 1484,S
Provence was usually a part of the division of the Frankish realm known as Kingdom of Burgundy which was treated as its own kingdom,S
Their title sometimes appears as rector Provinciae,S
Out of this division came the Kingdom of Provence given to Lothairs youngest son Charles,S
A heritage of royal rule was thus inaugurated in Provence that though it was often subsumed into one of its larger neighbouring kingdoms it was just as often proclaiming its own sovereigns,S
The kingdom of Provence was also known as Lower Burgundy or Cisjurane Burgundy,S
Its capital was first Vienne then Arles and it is therefore sometimes known as Arelate,S
Charles 855863Provence divided between surviving brothers Lothair II and the Emperor Louis II,S
Hugh never used the royal title in Provence,S
Firstly Hugh of Arles served as duke and regent during Louis long blindness,S
At the time the premier counts in the region were the counts of Arles and those of Avignon,S
William I and Rotbold II did not divide their fathers domains and this indivisibility was maintained by their respective descendants,S
It is thus impossible to ascertain who succeeded whom in the county as various reigns overlap,S
The margravial title also continued in their family until it passed to Bertrand Count of Toulouse in 1062,S
They coveted the region between the Cévennes and the Rhône then under the control of Toulouse,S
In 1112 the count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer III married the heiress of Provence Douce who was the daughter of the Countess Gerberga of Provence Gévaudan Carladais and part of Rodez,S
The marriage was probably taken at the urging of the church which was then in conflict with house of Toulouse,S

Kisaeng also spelled gisaeng sometimes called ginyeo 기녀 is Korea women the messengers and official foreigner in court for hospitality  prepared women,S
First appearing in the Goryeo Dynasty kisaeng were legally entertainers of the government required to perform various functions for the state,S
Many were employed at court but they were also spread throughout the country,S
They were carefully trained and frequently accomplished in the fine arts poetry and prose although their talents were often ignored due to their inferior social status,S
Some of Koreas oldest and most popular stories such as the tale of Chunhyang feature kisaeng as heroines,S
Although the names of most real kisaeng have been forgotten a few are remembered for an outstanding attribute such as talent or loyalty,S
They shared this status with other entertainers as well as butchers and slaves,S
Status was hereditary so the children of a kisaeng were also of cheonmin status and the daughters automatically became kisaeng as well,S
Beginning in the Goryeo period the governing offices in each district kept a registry of kisaeng to ensure thorough oversight,S
The same practice was followed for conscripted slaves,S
Kisaeng could only be released from their position if a hefty price was paid to the government this could usually only be done by a wealthy patron typically a high government official,S
Many kisaeng were skilled in poetry and numerous sijo composed by kisaeng have survived,S
These often reflect themes of heartache and parting similar to poems composed by scholars in exile,S
In addition some of the most famous kisaeng poems were composed to persuade prominent scholars to spend the night,S
Indeed the sijo style came to be associated with kisaeng women while women of yangban status focused on the gasa form,S
Kisaeng attached to a local government office were known as gwangi and their status was carefully differentiated from that of the common slaves also attached to the office,S
They were separately entered on the census rolls,S
The kisaeng were regarded as of significantly higher status than the slaves although technically they were all of cheonmin rank,S
In Koreas structured hierarchical society gisaeng were technically slaves,S
For this reason they were sometimes spoken of as possessing the body of the lower class but the mind of the aristocrat,S
Only a few kisaeng were able to maintain their business for very long beyond this time,S
It may be for this reason that the kisaeng training institutes accepted entrants as young as eight,S
All kisaeng even those who did not work as prostitute or entertainers were obliged by law to retire at age 50,S

The History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian 1923 by J,S
Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity 1982 by Kenneth Holum consider her mother to be Roman and Eudoxia to be a semibarbara halfbarbarian,S
However the primary sources are silent on her maternal ancestry,S
He was already deceased in 388,S
According to Zosimus Eudoxia started her life in Constantinople as a household member of Promotus magister militum of the Eastern Roman Empire,S
She is presumed to have been orphaned at the time of her arrival Her entry into the household of Promotus may indicate a friendship of the two magisters or a political alliance,S
She is therefore assumed to have already been acquainted with Arcadius during his years as junior partner to his father,S
Wendy Mayer considers Eudoxia to have been groomed as a vehicle for the ambitions of her foster family,S
Rufinus reportedly intended to marry his daughter to Arcadius and establish his own relation to the Theodosian dynasty,S
The wedding of Eudoxia to Arcadius was orchestrated by Eutropius one of the eunuch officials serving in the Great Palace of Constantinople,S
The marriage took place on 27 April 395 without the knowledge or consent of Rufinus,S
For Eutropius it was an attempt to increase his own influence over the emperor and hopefully ensure the loyalty of the new empress to himself,S
Arcadius himself may have been motivated in asserting his own will over that of his regent,S
Zosimus alleges that her son Theodosius was widely rumored to be the result of her affair with a courtier,S
Zosimus account of her life is generally hostile to Eudoxia and the accuracy of his tale is doubtful,S
She and Gainas the new magister militum are considered to have played a part in the stripping of all offices and subsequent execution of Eutropius in 399,S
However the extent and nature of her involvement are disputed,S
Nevertheless she seems to have increased her personal influence following his demise,S
On 9 January 400 Eudoxia was officially given the title of an Augusta,S
Official images of her in the manner similar to a male Augustus also went in circulation,S
The extent of her influence at matters of court and state has been a matter of debate among historians,S
Barbarians and Bishops Army Church and State in the Age of Arcadius and Chrysostom 1990 by J W H G Liebeschuetz considers her influence overestimated in primary sources while The Cambridge Ancient History XIII,S
The Late Empire AD 337425 1998 reports her dominating the government between 400 and her death in 404,S
In 403 Simplicius Prefect of Constantinople erected a statue dedicated to her on a column of porphyry and a base of marble,S
Arcadius renamed the town of Selymbria Silivri Eudoxiopolis after her though this name did not survive,S
Her role would bring her into conflict with John Chrysostom the Patriarch of Constantinople,S
Their initial opposition may have been his protests over the fall from power and execution of Eutropius,S
During his time as Archbishop John adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings which made him popular with the common people but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy,S
His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular with these groups,S
Being an opponent of Origens teachings he accused John of being too partial to the latters teachings,S
Theophilus had disciplined four Egyptian monks known as the Tall Brothers over their support of Origens teachings,S
They fled to and were welcomed by John,S
It resulted in his deposition and banishment,S
He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately as the people became tumultuous over his departure,S
There was also an earthquake the night of his arrest which Eudoxia took for a sign of Gods anger prompting her to ask Arcadius for Johns reinstatement,S
Her seventh and last pregnancy ended in either a miscarriage or according to pseudoMartyrius a second stillbirth,S
She was left bleeding and died of an infection shortly after,S

It took place between Indonesias declaration of independence in 1945 and the Dutch recognition of Indonesias independence at the end of 1949,S
The struggle lasted for over four years and involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals and two major international diplomatic interventions,S

The Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the Japanese army and within only three months of their initial attacks the Japanese had occupied the Dutch East Indies,S
Although this was done more for Japanese political advantage than from altruistic support of Indonesian independence this support created new Indonesian institutions including local neighbourhood organisations and elevated political leaders such as Sukarno,S
With Japan on the brink of losing the war the Dutch sought to reestablish their authority in Indonesia and asked that the Japanese Army preserve law and order in Indonesia,S

21 is the second studio album by English recording artist Adele,S
Adele began writing 21 in April 2009 when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record,S
She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs,S
The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and appeared in the 2012 edition of the Guinness World Records,S
In response to the medias typecasting her as an old soul due to the vintage production and sentimental nature of her songs Adele decided on a more upbeat and contemporary second album,S
Adele had written Take It All during a difficult moment in her relationship,S
When she played the song for her boyfriend the two got into a bitter argument that culminated in the end of their 18month relationship,S
Heartbroken but musically stimulated Adele channelled her rush of emotions into her music crafting songs that examined her failed relationship from the perspectives of vengeful exlover heartbroken victim and nostalgic old flame,S
Within a day of her breakup she contacted producer Paul Epworth intent on capturing her emotion in a song Wed had a fuming argument the night before,S
Then I went into the studio and screamed,S
Although she had initially planned on completing a ballad that she had begun writing with Epworth more than a year ago the producer suggested that she aim for a more aggressive sound,S
In two days a demo was recorded to be produced by Columbia Records copresident Rick Rubin later that year,S
However Adele reapproached Epworth months later to complete production of the song,S
The demo was integral to the finished song,S
Epworth developed the instrumentation over Adeles singletake vocal demo after subsequent recordings failed to recapture the raw emotion of her first attempt,S
The track as it appears on the album still includes the faint audio of Epworths counting off the singer in the vocal booth immediately before she begins to sing,S
British producer Fraser T Smith recalled following a similar trajectory when he teamed up with Adele to compose the subsequent third single Set Fire to the Rain at his MyAudiotonic Studios in London,S
After the two had created the demo Adele revisited her cowriter to record the song with him instead of the intended producer Rick Rubin,S
Smith thought Adeles first attempt superior to subsequent takes and used the demo as the final production of the song complete with live drum sounds and an elaborate strings section arranged by British musician Rosie Danvers,S
With the demos to two songs recorded Adele approached American musician and OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder who was in London at the time for a radio show,S
Tedder had expressed interest in collaborating with the singer after they met at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony in February,S
He arrived four hours early to their first studio session buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work,S
Coincidentally it perfectly captured the experience of the singer who arrived at the studio moments after another altercation with her former lover,S
Angry and unfocused she denounced her exlovers tendency to turn the tables on her during their arguments an expression that Tedder decided to reference in the songs lyrics,S
Adele recorded the demo with Jim Abbis the following day,S
Adele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record Rumour Has It,S
I looked at the engineer then at her and said Adele I dont know what to tell you but I have never had anyone do that in ten years,S
At the suggestion of Columbia Records group president Ashley Newton she met with American songwriter Greg Wells at his studio in Culver City Los Angeles where they cowrote the gospeltinged ballad One and Only,S
The song evolved from a fourchord piano progression in a 68metre which Wells had conceived before meeting with the singer,S
The lyrics aimed at the singers new love interest came together quickly and were later completed with Dan Wilson with whom she also composed Someone Like You,S
In the initial stage of the albums production Rubin had signed on as its sole producer and was scheduled to produce all of its songs,S
Rubin notorious for his unorthodox production style pushed the singer beyond her comfort zone and despite being drawn to his unconventional methods Adele described working with the producer as daunting,S
He also decided against the use of music samples and electronic instruments,S
An advocate of a more freeform approach to musicmaking Rubin relied on the moods and feelings behind the music itself to guide the instrumental and melodic arrangement of the songs,S
He isolated the singer in the studio and encouraged her as well as his team of musicians to approach the production process with more spontaneity and less restraint,S
The singer even recalled moving the musicians and production team to tears while recording some of the songs,S
In an interview he commented on the nature of the recording sessionsAfter recording the album with Rubin Adele was dissatisfied with many of the songs,S
Ultimately she decided to scrap most work done in favour of the early takes she did with other producers including Epworth and Tedder in order for the music to reflect the raw emotion felt immediately after her breakup,S
From her collaboration with Rubin only five songs appeared on the album Dont You Remember He Wont Go Ill Be Waiting One and Only as well as the USonly track I Found a Boy,S
Weeks after her stint with Rubin Adele learned of her exlovers recent engagement inspiring the composition of the albums final track Someone Like You,S
Adeles record label was initially dissatisfied with the songs sparse production which comprised Adeles voice alongside a sole piano and requested that it be rerecorded with Rubins band,S
However the singer opted to keep the arrangement stating that the song was personal to her and that she wrote it to free herself,S
Im more patient  more forgiving and more aware of my own flaws  Something that comes with age I think,S
So fittingly this record is called 21  Like a photo album you see progression and change  throughout the years,S
However the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences,S
Frequent smoke breaks with her tour bus driver a Nashville Tennessee native resulted in her introduction to bluegrass and rockabilly and the music of Garth Brooks Wanda Jackson Alison Krauss Lady Antebellum Dolly Parton and Rascal Flatts,S
Although influenced by Adeles interest in country music at the time 21 remains faithful to the Motown influences of 19 and exhibits both gospel and soul music inflections,S
Instruments such as the saxophone harp banjo and the accordion contributed to its exploration of blues and soul,S
John Murphy of musicOMH characterises the album as British soul,S
Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that the albums music is a part of a recent British soul revival that summoned styles dating back to Motown girl groups and Dusty Springfield,S
Danyel Smith of Billboard views that Adeles music exhibits influences from Northern soul Aretha Franklin Sade and Bette Midler,S
Larry Flick of SiriusXM called 21 a pop record with soul leanings while The Washington Posts Allion Stewart commented on the albums eclectic nature Everything on 21 is precisely calibrated to transcend genres to withstand trends,S
Jon Caramanica of The New York Times pointed out the songs hollow counterpoint vocals and slow daringly morbid bridge that veers from the pounding rhythm before once again acceding to it,S
In Turning Tables a song of domestic dispute its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative exlover,S
Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak,S
Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals with a mixture of anger pain and pathos,S
The Rick Rubinproduced fourth track Dont You Remember cowritten by Adele and Dan Wilson marks a shift in the albums theme from anger and defensiveness to reflection and heartbreak,S
A downtempo country musicstyled ballad the song was added late to the production of the album after the singer grew ashamed of her continued negative portrayal of her exlover throughout the album,S
Its lyrics entreat a past lover to remember the happier moments at the beginning of a now broken relationship,S
In Set Fire to the Rain the singer delineates the conflicting stages of a troubled union and wrestles with her inability to fully let go,S
To achieve a fuller sound producer Fraser T Smith incorporated the popular wall of sound reverberative technique in framing the songs dense instrumentation,S
Take It All the seventh track written and recorded with Francis Eg White and Jim Abbis before the breakdown of Adeles relationship is a piano and vocal ballad that borrows heavily from pop soul and gospel,S
The track precedes Ill Be Waiting the second of two songs produced by Epworth which diverges from the scathing Rolling in the Deep in its optimistic tone and brisk lilted melody,S
A protagonists mea culpa for a relationship gone wrong she declares to wait patiently for her lovers inevitable return,S
The song was compared to the work of Aretha Franklin for its huge vocal sound on the chorus rolling piano and boxy snare while Tom Townshend of MSN Music described its brass section as a Rolling Stonesesque barroom gospel,S
Although the album predominantly explores the singers failed relationship not all songs were geared towards her exlover,S
He Wont Go a nod to hip hop and contemporary RB was a tribute to a friend who battled heroin addiction,S
In interviews the singer described it as the summation of her attitude towards her exlover by the end of the albums production,S
The songs lyrics describe a protagonists attempt at dealing with her heartbreak after she learns of her exlovers recent marriage and happy new life,S
One of the more commended songs on the album Someone Like You was praised for its lyrical depth and understated simplicity,S
With 21 Adele became the first female to have three singles simultaneously in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 as a solo artist,S
According to Sasha FrereJones of The New Yorker the albums success in the US can be attributed to its target audiencethat is middleaged moms  the demographic that decides American elections,S
The first  revolves around oodles of hype and evermore preposterous wardrobe selections,S
With the release of 21 critics began to tout Adele as the new torchbearer for the British soul music that ascended to the American mainstream via Duffy Joss Stone Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen,S

They were submarine aircraft carriers able to carry three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft underwater to their destinations,S
They were designed to surface launch their planes then quickly dive again before they were discovered,S
The I400class was designed with the range to travel anywhere in the world and return,S
A fleet of 18 boats was planned in 1942 and work started on the first in January 1943 at the Kure Hiroshima arsenal,S
Within a year the plan was scaled back to five of which only three I400 at Kure and and I402 at Sasebo were completed,S
He commissioned Captain Kameto Kuroshima to make a feasibility study,S
Yamamoto submitted the resulting proposal to Fleet Headquarters on 13 January 1942,S
It called for a fleet of 18 large submarines capable of making three roundtrips to the west coast of the United States without refueling or one roundtrip to any point on the globe,S
They also had to be able to store and launch at least two attack aircraft armed with one torpedo or bomb,S
By 17 March general design plans for the submarines were finalized,S
Construction of I400 commenced at Kure Dock Yards on 18 January 1943 and four more boats followed I401 April 1943 and I402 Oct 1943 at Sasebo I403 Sept 1943 at Kobe and I404 February 1944 at Kure,S
Following Yamamotos death when his plane was shot down during an inspection tour of the Solomon Islands in April 1943 the number of aircraftcarrying submarines to be built was reduced from eighteen to nine then five and finally three,S
Only I400 and I401 actually entered service I402 was completed on 24 July 1945 five weeks before the end of the war but never made it to sea,S
The crosssection of its pressure hull had a unique figureofeight shape which afforded the necessary strength and stability to handle the weight of a large ondeck aircraft hangar,S
One Type 11 deck gun was positioned aft of the hangar,S
Eight torpedo tubes were mounted in the bow four above and four below,S
Stowed in an open recessed compartment on the forward port side just below top deck was a collapsible crane used to retrieve the submarines Seiran floatplanes,S
The crane had an electrically operated hoist and was capable of lifting approximately,S
Strung along the submarines gunwales were two parallel sets of demagnetization cables running from the stern to the bow planes,S
These were intended to dissipate the static charge that normally builds up when a boats hull slices through the water causing the steel in the hull to deteriorate over time,S
Electronics on board the I400s included a Mark 3 Model 1 air search radar equipped with two separate antennas,S
The boats were also equipped with Mark 2 Model 2 airsurface radar sets with distinctive hornshaped antennas,S
Each boat carried an E27 radar warning receiver connected to both a trainable dipole antenna and a fixed nondirectional antenna made up of a wire mesh basket and two metal rods,S
The submarines were equipped with two periscopes of German manufacture about long one for use during daylight and the other at night,S
This retrofit occurred while the boat was laid up at Kure for repairs after being damaged by an American mine in April,S
I402 was completed shortly before the war ended but had been converted during building to a tanker and was never equipped with aircraft,S

A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft,S
Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton who developed a waterjet in 1954 for operation in the fastflowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters,S
Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers,S
Unlike these previous waterjet developments such as Campinis and the Hanley Hydrojet Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in veryshallow water and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution,S
There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application,S
Classic propdrives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds up to about  but as boat speed increases beyond this the extra hull resistance generated by struts rudders shafts etc,S
Also in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds such as tug boats the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical,S
For these reasons the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in highspeed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught maneuverability and load flexibility are main concerns,S
The biggest jetdriven vessels are found in military use or the highspeed passengercar ferry industry,S
One of the jetboats was sunk by a friend of Hillary,S

Revolution OS is a 2001 documentary film that traces the twentyyear history of GNU Linux open source and the free software movement,S
Directed by J T S Moore the film features interviews with prominent hackers and entrepreneurs including Richard Stallman Michael Tiemann Linus Torvalds Larry Augustin Eric S Raymond Bruce Perens Frank Hecker and Brian Behlendorf,S
It discusses how change came in 1978 as Bill Gates in his Open Letter to Hobbyists pointedly prodded hobbyists to pay up,S
Stallman relates his struggles with proprietary software vendors at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab leading to his departure to focus on the development of free software and the GNU project,S
Torvalds describes the development of the Linux kernel the GNULinux naming controversy Linuxs further evolution and its commercialization,S
Raymond and Stallman clarify the philosophy of free software versus communism and capitalism as well as the development stages of Linux,S
Michael Tiemann discusses meeting Stallman in 1987 getting an early version of Stallmans GCC and founding Cygnus Solutions,S
Larry Augustin describes combining GNU software with a normal PC to create a Unixlike workstation at one third the price and twice the power of a Sun workstation,S
He relates his early dealings with venture capitalists the eventual capitalization and commodification of Linux for his own company VA Linux and its IPO,S
Brian Behlendorf one of the original developers of the Apache HTTP Server explains that he started to exchange patches for the NCSA web server daemon with other developers which led to the release of a patchy webserver dubbed Apache,S
This point was validated further after the films release as the Netscape source code eventually became the Firefox web browser reclaiming a large percentage of market share from Microsofts Internet Explorer,S
The film also documents the scope of the first fullscale LinuxWorld Summit conference with appearances by Linus Torvalds and Larry Augustin on the keynote stage,S
Much of the footage for the film was shot in Silicon Valley,S
Ron Wells of Film Threat found the film important worthwhile and well thought out for explaining the principles of the free software and open source concepts,S
Noting its failure to represent on camera any debate with representatives of the proprietary software camp Wells gave the film 4 of 5 stars,S
Daily Variety saw the film as targeted equally at the technoilliterate and the savvyhacker crowd educating and patting one group on the head and canonizing the other but strong enough for an enjoyable recommendation,S
On the negative side the New York Times faulted the films onesidedness found its reliance on jargon fairly dense going and gave no recommendation,S
Internet Reviews found it a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy,S
lacking followthrough on Red Hat and VALinux stock in 2007 at 2 of peak value with lots of talking heads,S
Toxicuniversecom noted Revolution OS blatantly serves as infomercial and propaganda,S
Bearded throwback to the sixties hacker Richard Stallman serves as the movements spiritual leader while Scandinavian Linus Torvalds acts as its mild mannered chief engineer as developer of the Linux kernel,S
To Tim Lord reviewing for Slashdot the film is interesting and worthy of viewing with some misgivings it is about the growth of the free software movement and its eventual cooption by the open source movement,S
it was supposed to be about Linux and its battle about Microsoft but the movie is quickly hijacked by its participants,S
The film lacks the staple of documentaries scenes with multiple people that are later analyzed individually by each of the participants or indeed much backandforth at all,S
Linux itself and its benefits are notably missing and are never shown anyone using Linux except for unhappy users at an Installfest,S
The debate over Linux vs Windows is missing showing the origin of the OS only as a response to proprietary and expensive Sun and DEC software and hardware and its growth solely due to the Apache web server,S
And Lord notes that the film shows but does not challenge Torvalds or Stallman about their equally disingenuous remarks about the Linux vs GNULinux naming issue,S

In 1993 Japanese pro wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki traveled to the Netherlands to scout fighters for their new hybrid wrestling Bushido wrestling organization featuring submission fighting but with no closed fisted strikes to the face,S
A precursor to modern mixed martial arts the organization was the first of its kind and featured early MMA names Frank Shamrock Vernon White Maurice Smith Ken Shamrock and Guy Mezger,S
Rutten dominated his first two fights in Pancrase winning each by KO,S
Ruttens first knockout was so brutal that his opponent Ryushi Yanagisawa then the 4 ranked fighter in Japan was carried from the ring and spent 2 days in a hospital,S
Ruttens striking was so powerful that according to Frank Shamrock it often intimidated other fighters,S
Frank Shamrock said His kickboxing was devastating,S
The other thing he had was a basic understanding of real fightingBas had that street fighter mentality,S
However his lack at that time of groundfighting experience led to a loss to the extraordinarily skilled Masakatsu Funaki,S
Rutten realizing the importance of ground fighting went to train with the master shoot wrestler Funaki,S

A whistled language is a system of whistled communication which allows fluent whistlers to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances,S
Whistled languages are different in this respect from the restricted codes sometimes used by herders or animal trainers to transmit simple messages or instructions,S
Generally whistled languages emulate the tones or vowel formants of a natural spoken language as well as aspects of its intonation and prosody so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message,S
Whistled language is rare compared to spoken language but it is found in cultures around the world,S
It is especially common in tone languages where the whistled tones transmit the tones of the syllables tone melodies of the words,S
This might be because in tone languages the tone melody carries more of the functional load of communication while nontonal phonology carries proportionally less,S
The genesis of a whistled language has never been recorded in either case and has not yet received much productive study,S
Tonal languages are often stripped of articulation leaving only suprasegmental features such as duration and tone and when whistled retain the spoken melodic line,S
Thus whistled tonal languages convey phonemic information solely through tone length and to a lesser extent stress and most segmental phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are lost,S
In nontonal languages more of the articulatory features of speech are retained and the normally timbral variations imparted by the movements of the tongue and soft palate are transformed into pitch variations,S
Certain consonants can be pronounced while whistling so as to modify the whistled sound much as consonants in spoken language modify the vowel sounds adjacent to them,S
Different whistling styles may be used in a single language,S
Sochiapam Chinantec has three different words for whistlespeech sie3 for whistling with the tongue against the alveolar ridge jui32 for bilabial whistling and juo2 for fingerinthemouth whistling,S
These are used for communication over varying distances,S
There is also a kind of loud falsetto hóh32 which functions in some ways like whistled speech,S
For example in some tonal languages with few tones whistled messages typically consist of stereotyped or otherwise standardized expressions are elaborately descriptive and often have to be repeated,S
In any case even for nontonal languages measurements indicate that high intelligibility can be achieved with whistled speech 90 of intelligibility of nonstandardized sentences for Greek and the equivalent for Turkish,S
However while drums may be used by griots singing praise songs or for intervillage communication and other instruments may be used on the radio for station identification jingles for regular conversation at a distance whistled speech is used,S
The number of distinctive sounds or phonemes in this language is a matter of disagreement varying according to the researcher from two to five vowels and four to nine consonants,S
This variation may reflect differences in speakers abilities as well as in the methods used to elicit contrasts,S
The work of Meyer clarifies this debate by providing the first statistical analyses of production for various whistlers as well as psycholinguistic tests of vowel identification,S
They are especially common and robust today in parts of West Africa used widely in such populous languages as Yoruba and Ewe,S
Even French is whistled in some areas of western Africa,S
Most whistle languages of which there are several hundred are based on tonal languages,S
Only the tone of the speech is saved in the whistle things such as articulation and phonation are eliminated,S
These are replaced by other features such as stress and rhythmical variations,S
A similar language is the Tsonga whistle language used in the highlands in the Southern parts of Mozambique,S
This should not be confused with the whistled sibilants of Shona,S
Whistled speech may be very central and highly valued in a culture,S
Shouting is very rare in Sochiapam Chinantec,S
Men in that culture are subject to being fined if they do not handle whistlespeech well enough to perform certain town jobs,S
They may whistle for fun in situations where spoken speech could easily be heard,S
In Sochiapam Oaxaca and other places in Mexico and reportedly in West Africa as well whistled speech is mens language although women may understand it they do not use it,S
Stories are told of farmers in Aas during World War II or in La Gomera who were able to hide evidence of such nefarious activities as milkwatering because they were warned in whistlespeech that the police were approaching,S
They have been more recently found in dense forests like the Amazon where they may replace spoken dialogues in the villages while hunting or fishing to overcome the pressure of the acoustic environment,S
The main advantage of whistling speech is that it allows the speaker to cover much larger distances typically but up to in mountains and less in reverberating forests than ordinary speech without the strain and lesser range of shouting,S
The long range of whistling is enhanced by the mountainous terrain found in areas where whistled languages are used,S
Many areas with such languages work hard to preserve their ancient traditions in the face of rapidly advancing telecommunications systems in many areas,S
Normal articulation during an ordinary lipwhistle is relatively easy though the lips move little causing a constant of labialization and making labial and labiodental consonants p b m f etc,S
Apart from the five vowelphonemes Silbo Gomeroand even these do not invariably have a fixed or steady pitchall whistled speechsound realizations are glides which are interpreted in terms of range contour and steepness,S
In a nontonal language segments may be differentiated as followsVowels are replaced by a set of relative pitch ranges generally tracking the f2 formant of spoken language,S
Stress is expressed by higher pitch or increased lengthConsonants are produced by pitch transitions of different lengths and height plus the presence or absence of occlusion,S

Floris III of Holland 1141  August 1 1190 Count of Holland from 1157 to 1190,S
He was a son of Dirk VI and Sophia of Rheineck heiress of Bentheim,S
This was actually the legalisation of an existing situation because the counts of Holland had charged tolls illegally since the start of the 11th century,S
Many farmers came to Holland to turn the swamps into agricultural lands,S
Dikes and dams were built and the border between Holland and the bishopric of Utrecht had to be determined,S
There was a dispute between Floris and the bishop of Utrecht about a new dam in the Rhine at Zwammerdam in 1165 which had to be settled by emperor Frederick,S
The brother of Floris Baldwin became bishop of Utrecht in 1178,S
The Trip 35 is a 35mm compact camera manufactured by Olympus,S
It was introduced in 1967 and discontinued after a lengthy production run in 1984,S
The Trip name was a reference to its intended market  people who wanted a compact functional camera for holidays,S
During the 1970s it was the subject of an advertising campaign that featured popular British photographer David Bailey,S
Over ten million units were sold,S
The Trip 35 was a point and shoot model with a 40mm f28 lens solarpowered selenium light meter and just two shutter speeds,S
In A mode the camera operated as a Program automatic choosing either 140th sec or 1200th sec,S
The camera could also sync with flash and had a range of aperture settings from f28 to f22,S
In flash sync mode the shutter was set at 140,S
Apart from a simple fourposition zone focus system and an ISO setting from 25400 the camera had no other photographic controls,S
Its lens was a coated Zuiko 40mm f28 with four elements in three groups,S
The camera had an ISO range of only 25400 but this was acceptable as films faster than 400 were uncommon and not of high image quality,S
25 speed allowed the use of Kodachrome while 400 speed allowed use of TriX and similar fast materials under low light,S
The use of a selenium photocell to select the shutter speeds and aperture let novices use the camera as a point  shoot with good results obtained most of the time,S

In this cycle a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor,S
The vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor superheated,S
The superheated vapor travels through the condenser which first cools and removes the superheat and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature,S
The liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve also called a throttle valve where its pressure abruptly decreases causing flash evaporation and autorefrigeration of typically less than half of the liquid,S
That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure,S
The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet to complete the thermodynamic cycle,S
Nowadays the vapor absorption cycle is used only where heat is more readily available than electricity such as waste heat provided by solar collectors or offthegrid refrigeration in recreational vehicles,S
The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor,S
Some work is required by the liquid pump but for a given quantity of refrigerant it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle,S
In an absorption refrigerator a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used,S
Air is most often this working fluid,S
As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gastogas heat exchangers in gas cycles,S
The gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse Brayton cycle instead of the reverse Rankine cycle,S
As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature,S
In the gas cycle the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side,S
Therefore for the same cooling load a gas refrigeration cycle will require a large mass flow rate and would be bulky,S
Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk air cycle coolers are not often applied in terrestrial refrigeration,S
These jet aircrafts cooling and ventilation units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft cabin,S

It fell to Richard Swann Lull to complete the monograph in 1905 publishing Hatchers description of a skull separately and giving it the name Diceratops hatcheri Diceratops means two horned face,S
Since the Diceratops paper had been written by Hatcher and Lull had only contributed the name and published the paper after Hatchers death Lull was not quite as convinced of the distinctiveness of Diceratops thinking it primarily pathological,S
By 1933 Lull had had second thoughts about Diceratops being a distinct genus and he put it in a subgenus of Triceratops Triceratops Diceratops hatcheri including T obtusus largely attributing its differences to being that of an aged individual,S

Vasil Levski  originally spelled Василъ Лѣвскій pronounced  born Vasil Ivanov Kunchev Васил Иванов Кунчев 18 July 1837  18 February 1873 was a Bulgarian revolutionary and is a national hero of Bulgaria,S
Born in the SubBalkan town of Karlovo to middle class parents Levski became an Orthodox monk before emigrating to join the two Bulgarian Legions in Serbia and other Bulgarian revolutionary groups,S
In Romania Levski helped institute the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee composed of Bulgarian expatriates,S
During his tours of Bulgaria Levski established a wide network of insurrectionary committees,S
Levski looked beyond the act of liberation he envisioned a pure and sacred Bulgarian republic of ethnic and religious equality,S
His concepts have been described as a struggle for human rights inspired by the progressive liberalism of the French Revolution and 19th century Western European society,S
Levski is commemorated with monuments in Bulgaria and Serbia and numerous national institutions bear his name,S
He was the namesake of his maternal uncle Archimandrite superior abbot Basil Василий Vasiliy,S
Levskis parents Ivan Kunchev and Gina Kuncheva née Karaivanova came from a family of clergy and craftsmen and represented the emerging Bulgarian middle class,S
An eminent but struggling local craftsman Kunchev died in 1844,S
Levski had two younger brothers Hristo and Petar and an older sister Yana another sister Maria died during childhood,S
Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later described the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile wiry appearancewith light greyishblue eyes blond hair and a small moustache,S
Hitovs memories of Levskis appearance are supported by Levskis contemporaries revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev,S
The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel,S
Levski began his education at a school in Karlovo studying homespun tailoring as a local craftsmans apprentice,S
In 1855 Levskis uncle Basilarchimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monasterytook him to Stara Zagora where he attended school and worked as Basils servant,S
Afterward Levski joined a clerical training course,S
On 7 December 1858 he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the religious name Ignatius Игнатий Ignatiy and was promoted in 1859 to hierodeacon which later inspired one of Levskis informal nicknames The Deacon Дякона Dyakona,S
Abandoning his service as a monk Levski enlisted as a volunteer,S
At the time relations between the Serbs and their Ottoman suzerains were tense,S
Militant conflicts in Belgrade were eventually resolved diplomatically and the First Bulgarian Legion was disbanded under Ottoman pressure on 12 September 1862,S
His courage during training and fighting earned him his nickname Levski Lionlike,S
After the legions disbandment Levski joined Ilyo Voyvodas detachment at Kragujevac but returned to Rakovski in Belgrade after discovering that Ilyos plans to invade Bulgaria had failed,S
In the spring of 1863 Levski returned to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania,S
His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months later released due to the help of the doctor R Petrov and the Russian viceconsul Nayden Gerov,S
On Easter 1864 Levski officially relinquished his religious office,S
From May 1864 until March 1866 he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo while there he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic companies among the population,S
As his activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities he was forced to move and from the spring of 1866 to the spring of 1867 he taught in Enikyoy and Kongas two Northern Dobruja villages near Tulcea,S
Two revolutionary bands led by Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu had been inciting the Bulgarian diasporic community in Romania to invade Bulgaria and organise antiOttoman resistance,S
On the recommendation of Rakovski Vasil Levski was selected as the standardbearer of Hitovs detachment,S
In April 1867 the band crossed the Danube at Tutrakan moved through the Ludogorie region and reached the Balkan Mountains,S
After skirmishing the band fled to Serbia through Pirot in August,S
In Serbia the government was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals,S
Levski was a prominent member of the Legion but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric disease that required surgery,S
Bedridden he could not participate in the Legions training,S
After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned,S
Upon his release he went to Romania where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments,S
For various reasons including his stomach problems and strategic differences Levski did not participate,S
In the winter of 1868 he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest,S
On 11 December 1868 he travelled by steamship from Turnu Măgurele to Istanbul the starting point of a trek that lasted until 24 February 1869 when Levski returned to Romania,S
During this canvassing and reconnaissance mission Levski is thought to have visited Plovdiv Perushtitsa Karlovo Sopot Kazanlak Sliven Tarnovo Lovech Pleven and Nikopol establishing links with local patriots,S
They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government,S
Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol Pleven Karlovo Plovdiv Pazardzhik Perushtitsa Stara Zagora Chirpan Sliven Lovech Tarnovo Gabrovo Sevlievo and Tryavna,S
According to some researchers Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour but those assumptions are based on uncertain data,S
From late August 1869 to May the following year Levski was active in the Romanian capital Bucharest,S
He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing,S
Karavelovs publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee BRCC a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter,S
In disagreement over planning Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to actualise his concept of an internal revolutionary network,S
Through clandestine channels of reliable people relations were maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community,S
The internal correspondence employed encryption conventional signs and fake personal and committee names,S
Although Levski himself headed the organisation he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monkturnedrevolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski the adventurous Dimitar Obshti and the young Angel Kanchev,S
Apocryphal and semilegendary anecdotal stories surround the creation of Levskis Internal Revolutionary Organisation,S
Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels,S
For example he is known to have dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes,S
In the autumn of 1871 Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People a BRCC draft statute containing ideological organisational and penal sections,S
It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion,S
The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872 at the time his views on the revolution had clearly matured,S
As IRO expanded it coordinated its activities more with the Bucharestbased BRCC,S
On Levskis initiative a general assembly was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872,S
After attending the assembly Levski returned to Bulgaria and reorganised IROs internal structure in accordance with BRCCs recommendations,S
Thus the Lovech Central Committee was reduced to a regular local committee and the first regionwide revolutionary centres were founded,S
The lack of funds however precipitated the organisation into a crisis and Levskis oneman judgements on important strategic and tactical matters were increasingly questioned,S
While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125000 groschen Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested,S
The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisations size and its close relations with BRCC,S
Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levskis leading role,S
Realising that he was in danger Levski decided to flee to Romania where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events,S
First however he had to collect important documentation from the committee archive in Lovech which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans,S
He stayed at the nearby village inn in Kakrina where he was surprised and arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872,S
Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov the most accepted version has been that a priest named Krastyo Nikiforov betrayed Levski to the police,S
This theory has been disputed by the researchers Ivan Panchovski and Vasil Boyanov for lack of evidence,S
Ottoman authorities sentenced Levski to death by hanging,S
Although he was recognised as an instigator of a major armed uprising the death sentence was based on a Lovech servants murder that Levski committed while attempting to extort money from a wealthy local,S
The sentence was carried out on in Sofia where the Monument to Vasil Levski now stands,S
The location of Levskis grave is uncertain but in the 1980s writer Nikolay Haytov campaigned for the Church of St Petka of the Saddlers as Levskis burial place which the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences concluded as possible yet unverifiable,S
Levskis death intensified the crisis in the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and most IRO committees soon disintegrated,S
Nevertheless five years after his hanging the RussoTurkish War of 18771878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the wake of the April Uprising of 1876,S
The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established the Bulgarian state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under de jure Ottoman suzerainty,S

In 1609 he retired and his other son Tadamasa took over Kuwana,S
His grandson Tadatoki married the granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu Senhime,S

On 3 July 2009 Canadian artist Michael R Barrick created two composite images depicting Pedobear grouped together with the mascots of 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games,S
One is based on the official art and the other is based on fanart created by Angela Melick,S
This image was then mistakenly used by other media most notably the Polish newspaper Gazeta Olsztyńska for a 4 February 2010 front page story about the Olympics in Vancouver,S
On 24 July 2009 a column by conservative commentator Pat Buchanan about the early months of Barack Obamas presidency included an image of Pedobear which generated considerable reaction from nonpolitical commentators,S
In December 2010 Big Fish Games published a flash game called Teddy Bears Christmas featuring Pedobear as the main character,S
On March 22 2011 the blog Urlesque posted a photograph of a coupon book advertisement for CP Distributor a computer repair business in Polk County Florida CP in a Pedobear context normally stands for child porn,S
The Banū Aws   Sons of Aws or simply Aws  also Romanized as Aus was one of the main Arab tribes of Medina,S
Shia sources say they were Jews while a Jewish source says they and the Banu Khazraj were Arab tribes from Yemen who came to Medina in the fourth century CE,S
The Jewish source continues to say that the two tribes took the power of Medina from the Jews in the fifth century By calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet,S
However all sources agree that the Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other,S
A Shia source states that they had been fighting for one hundred and twenty years and were sworn enemies,S
The Jewish source states that they went to war against each other in the Battle of Buath a few years before the Islamic prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina,S
There were many Jewish tribes then present in Medina Banu Nadir Banu Qurayza Banu Qaynuqa and many more,S
During the battle The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza fought with the Banu Aus while the Banu Qaynuqa were allied with the Banu Khazraj,S
The Apocryphon of James also known by the translation of its title  the Secret Book of James is a pseudonymous text amongst the New Testament apocrypha,S
It describes the secret teachings of Jesus to Peter and James given after the Resurrection but before the Ascension,S
A major theme is that one must accept suffering as inevitable,S
The prominence of James and Peter suggest that the work originated in the Jewish Christian community,S
It shows no dependence on canonical texts and was probably written in the midtolate 2nd century,S
Although the text appears to be a Coptic translation from Greek the author claims to have written in Hebrew,S
Because of references to persecution and martyrdom it is unlikely that the text was written after 313 when Constantine I ended Christian persecution,S
Other clues in the text point to a composition in the 2nd century and perhaps in the first half,S
The author describes Jesus expanding on various sayings and answering questions 550 days after the Resurrection but before the Ascension,S
As with the Gospel of John 120 and the Gospel of Mary in this book Peter has implicitly failed the Christian movement,S
Jesus gives teachings in unusual and seemingly contradictory phrases and also offers brief parables,S
He invites Peter and James into the Kingdom of Heaven with him but they are distracted by the other apostles questions and miss their chance,S
Afterwards James is described as sending out the 12 apostles indicating as in other apocryphal documents that James initially succeeded Jesus as the leader of the movement,S
The brief framing letter appears independent of the remainder of the text suggesting to some that the Apocryphon may have originated as multiple separate texts redacted together,S
This framing letter references a previous secret gospel which has apparently been lost,S
Within the Apocryphon the discussions of martyrdom and prophecy also appear to be somewhat separate indicating an original text for the main body of the document which was composed of brief sayings,S
It is still debated whether the closest parallels to the New Testament canon are part of the Apocryphons last redactional hand or else part of its sources,S
The manuscript was also found among explicit gnostic teachings in the Nag Hammadi Library,S
But its introduction says And five hundred and fifty days after he arose from the dead we said to him  which is considerably longer than the forty days which Lukes Acts of the Apostles gives for the Ascension,S
Some have felt that this implies that the relationship of the Apocryphon of James with the canon is through oral tradition and that the community which wrote it rejected or else did not know LukeActs,S
The discography of American singer David Archuleta consists of five studio albums four extended plays twentyone singles four as featured performer and eight music videos,S
The Banu alKhazraj  was one of the tribes of Arabia during Muhammads era,S
However all sources agree that the Banu Khazraj and Banu Aus became hostile to each other,S
Jewish chronicles state that they went to war against each other in the Battle of Buath a few years before the Islamic prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina,S
There were three Jewish tribes present in Medina Banu Qaynuqa Banu Nadir and Banu Qurayza,S
During the battle The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza fought on the side of the Banu Aus while the Banu Qaynuqa were allied with the Banu Khazraj,S

The Sophia of Jesus Christ is one of many Gnostic tractates from the Nag Hammadi codices discovered in Egypt in 1945,S
The Coptic manuscript itself has been dated to the 4th century however it is complemented by a few fragments in Greek dating from the 3rd century implying an earlier date,S
The debate about dating is critical since some argue that it reflects the true recorded sayings of Jesus which is possible if they were to be dated as far back as the 1st century,S
Others argue that they are in fact considerably later and constitute an unreliable secondary source at best post facto hearsay,S
Most scholars argue that the text is of Gnostic origin based on the similarities between the mystical teachings found in the text itself and standard Gnostic themes,S
Highly mystical the content of this text concerns creation of gods angels and the universe with an emphasis on infinite and metaphysical truth,S
from The Sophia of Jesus ChristThe text is composed of 13 questions from the disciples followed by brief discourses by Jesus in response,S
The second concerns how to find truth but only explaining what it is not,S
The third concerns how truth was revealed to the gnostics at the beginning of time,S
The sixth concerns how mankind came to gnosis,S
The seventh concerns the position of Jesus in all this,S
The eighth concerns the identity of Jesus,S
The ninth concerns how the spirit connects to the material,S
The tenth concerns the number of spirits,S

Bernardo Strozzi c 1581  August 2 1644 was a prominent and prolific Italian Baroque painter born and active mainly in Genoa and also active in Venice,S
In 1598 at the age of 17 he joined a Capuchin monastery a reform branch of the Franciscan order,S
When his father died c 1608 he left the order to care for his mother earning their living with his paintings which were often influenced by Franciscan teachings for example his Adoration of the Shepherds c 1615,S
In 1625 he was charged with illegally practicing as a painter,S
When his mother died c 1630 Bernardo was pressured in court by the Capuchins to reenter the order,S
He was briefly imprisoned in Genoa and upon release fled to Venice to avoid confinement in a monastery in 1631,S
Early paintings such as The Ecstasy of St Francis show the dark emotionalism of Caravaggio,S
But by the second decade of the 17th century while working in Venice Strozzi had synthesized a personal style which fused painterly influences of the North including Rubens and Veronese with a monumental realistic starkness,S
He was also likely influenced by Velázquez who visited Genoa in 162930,S
After a commission to paint Claudio Monteverdi his fame grew and his portrait paintings included many of the leading Venetians,S
His pupils and other painters strongly influenced by him included Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari 15981669 Giovanni Bernardo Carbone Valerio Castello Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and Ermanno Stroifti,S

The Dialogue of the Saviour is one of the New Testament apocrypha texts that was found within the Nag Hammadi library of predominantly gnostic texts,S
The surviving portions indicate that the general content is a dialogue with Jesus in a similar manner to and possibly based on the Gospel of Thomas,S
The text is somewhat peculiarly constructed containing also a few large interruptions seemingly out of place within and only superficially edited into the dialogue,S
Starting with a series of questions ultimately concerning esoteric knowledge and its pursuit the text abruptly turns to a description of the origin of the world interrupted briefly by a return to dialogue,S
Finally the text returns to the questionbased dialogue,S
However due to the damage that the text has suffered study of it has so far proven too difficult to identify what these texts might be although the dialog shares an affinity with the Gospel of Thomas,S
Although the text appears to be misogynist in its command to destroy the works of femaleness it is generally considered that this was a reference to destroying sexuality and thus reproduction thus suppressing carnal desire,S

Doppelgänger is a 1969 British sciencefiction film directed by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes Ian Hendry Lynn Loring and Patrick Wymark,S
Outside Europe it is known as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun which is now the more popular title,S
In the film a joint EuropeanNASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth behind the Sun ends in disaster with the death of one of the astronauts Hendry,S
Using Pinewood Studios as the principal production base Parrish also filmed on location in both England and Portugal,S
The professional relationship between the Andersons and their director became strained as the shooting progressed while creative disagreements with cinematographer John Read resulted in his resignation from Century 21,S
Doppelgänger premiered in August 1969 in the United States and October 1969 in the United Kingdom,S
It has been termed a cult film,S
Actors and props from Doppelgänger would reappear in a later Anderson TV series UFO,S
EUROSEC director Jason Webb Patrick Wymark convinces NASA representative David Poulson Ed Bishop that the West must be the first to send a mission to investigate the planet,S
Three weeks after launch the astronauts are revived in the planets orbit,S
Scans for the existence of extraterrestrial life are inconclusive and Ross and Kane decide to make a surface landing,S
As the astronauts descend through the atmosphere an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle which crashes in a mountainous region that is revealed to be Ulan Bator Mongolia,S
Neuman and EUROSEC official Lise Hartman Loni von Friedl interrogate Ross who denies that he aborted the mission,S
Shortly after Kane dies from his injuries,S
Ross conjectures that the two Earths lie parallel inferring that his counterpart from this world is experiencing similar events on the far side of the Sun,S
EUROSEC builds a replacement for Dove designed to be compatible with the reversed technologies of Phoenix,S
Modifications include the reversepolarisation of the electric circuits although no one is certain that the differences between the two Earths extend to the direction of current,S
Ross christens the new shuttle Doppelganger a German word denoting a duplicate of a person or object,S
The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and loses contact with EUROSEC falling through the atmosphere towards the Space Centre with Ross struggling to disengage the automatic landing control,S
Ross is incinerated in the collision and a chain reaction destroys much of the Space Centre killing personnel and destroying all records of Rosss presence on the CounterEarth,S
Many years later an elderly and embittered Jason Webb long since dismissed from EUROSEC has been admitted to a nursing home,S
In his dementia he spies his reflection in a mirror mounted in front of a window,S
Rolling forwards in his wheelchair and reaching out to touch his reflected image Webb crashes through the mirror and dies,S
Talent agent Leslie Grade had since approached Anderson with a proposal for a film starring actor Arthur Haynes but discussions between Grade and Anderson had not produced a commission,S
In the summer of 1967 during the production of Andersons Supermarionation television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons Universal Pictures executive Jay Kanter arrived in London from the United States,S
Planning to establish a European production office Kanter expressed his willingness to provide funding for promising film ideas,S
Lew Grade brother to Leslie and Andersons financier at his TV distributor ITC Entertainment arranged a meeting with Kanter for Anderson to pitch a story concept concerning the hypothesis of a replicated or mirror Earth,S
Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had dark scripting Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise,S
Following that legend clearly I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word,S
When Kanter expressed dissatisfaction with the draft Gerry hired Donald James a novelist whom he considered a classy writer with a good reputation to strengthen the characterisation,S
Fundamentally the characters of Ross and Kane switched roles in the Andersons draft it was Ross who is injured in the Dove crash and Kane who was interrogated at the EUROSEC Space Centre,S
In scenes absent from the finished film Kane is diagnosed with brain damage as a result of his apparent insanity while Ross regains consciousness to find that the accident has left him blind,S
The return mission to Phoenix fails due not to an electrical fault but to a structural defect in the second Dove module which disintegrates in the atmosphere of the CounterEarth with Kane trapped inside,S
EUROSEC Headquarters is left intact and Kanes funeral is attended by his wife the Rosses and Jason Webb,S
Anderson would have selected David Lane who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels Thunderbirds Are Go 1966 and Thunderbird 6 1968,S
After a tenweek delay to filming Robert Parrish an American director whose latest project had been shelved accepted the role,S
Parrishs film career up to 1968 had included coediting Body and Soul for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing and codirecting the 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale,S
Anderson remembered Parrish as being very ingratiating stating that he told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us,S
Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business,S
He was a name director so we signed him up immediately,S
Anderson who perceived a likeness to fellow American actor Paul Newman cast Thinnes as the male lead after viewing his performance in the television series The Invaders 196768,S
In the Andersons draft script Rosss first name is Stewart and he is said to have been the first man to walk on Mars,S
In a 2008 interview Thinnes said I thought Doppelgänger was an interesting premise although now we know that there isnt another planet on the other side of the Sun through our space exploration and telescopic abilities,S
But at that time it was conceivable and it could have been scary,S
To conform to the scripts characterisation of Ross and to the detriment of his respiratory health Thinnes ended up smoking many packets worth of cigarettes in the course of the production,S
Ian Hendry stars as Dr John Kane British astrophysicist and head of the Phoenix project,S
Despite all that it looked exactly as it was supposed to onscreen,S
In the draft script Kanes first name is Philip and he has a wife called Susan,S
In scenes deleted from the completed film a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl is played out at Kanes villa and on a beach in Portugal,S
Lynn Loring stars as Sharon Ross the Colonels wife,S
Had she remained in the role Hunnicutt would have appeared in a nude scene scripted to distance the tone of Doppelgänger from that of earlier Anderson productions,S
In a 1968 interview in the Daily Mail newspaper Anderson expressed his intention to change the publics perception of Century 21 who in his view had been typecast as makers of childrens films,S
On rumours that Doppelgänger would receive an X certificate from the British Board of Film Censors BBFC for adult content he replied We want to work with live artists doing subjects unsuitable for children,S
For the final cut of the film the original nude shots were replaced with softer alternatives depicting Sharon stepping into and out of a shower,S
The draft script describes Sharon as the daughter of a United States Senator and she is said to be in a romantic affair with EUROSEC public relations officer Carlo Monetti,S
In the completed film Italian actor Franco De Rosa briefly stars as Paulo Landi,S
The affair is implied in one scene but not explored further prompting Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn authors of What Made Thunderbirds Go,S
The Authorised Biography of Gerry Anderson to suggest that De Rosa starred in a role all but cut from Doppelgänger,S
In a deleted scene on finding Paolo and Sharon in bed together at the Rosses villa Glenn angrily ejects the couple from the room and throws them both into a swimming pool,S
Archer and Hearn note an additional subplot concerning the Rosses attempts to conceive a child and the deceit of Sharon who has been using birth control pills to inhibit pregnancy without Glenns knowledge,S
Completing the main cast Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb director of EUROSEC,S
During the filming of one scene Wymark had to list these explanations  and on take after take he couldnt remember that two followed one,S
We had to do it over and over again,S
Archer and Hearn identify Wymarks portrayal of Webb a character described as John Wilder 2069 model in publicity material as the dominant performance of the film,S
The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology who is now romantically involved with his secretary Pam Kirby,S
Among the supporting cast George Sewell stars as Mark Neuman a German Operations Chief in EUROSEC who uncovers Dr Hasslers dealing with Communist China and whose parallel self directs the interrogation of Ross after the Dove crash,S
His surname in the draft script is Hallam,S
Finally Ed Bishop stars as David Poulson a NASA official,S
Filming in Borehamwood Hertfordshire used the exterior of Neptune House now part of the BBC Elstree Studios as a double for EUROSEC Headquarters in Portugal,S
To create the illusion of the parallel Earth  apparent in images such as reversed text  both quickly and cheaply the production staff inverted the film negatives using an optical process known as flopover,S
This technique saved the time and money that would otherwise needed to have been spent in building sets and props with specially reversed elements or organising road closures to film cars driving on the wrong side of the road,S
However the scenes set in or around the parallel EUROSEC Headquarters required careful rehearsal and coordination with cast and crew prior to filming,S
The incorporation of the flopover technique results in some continuity errors for example the terminals of the Heart Lung Kidney machines onboard Phoenix are seen to be connected first to Ross and Kanes left wrists then their right,S
The production staff encountered difficulties in realising a scene at the start of the film depicting an international teleconference being conducted using highresolution viewing monitors,S
Altered eyelines strengthen the audiences perception that each delegate is facing a camera rather than the other actors in the scene and are in different locations around the world,S
Archer and Hearn promote the teleconference scene as an example of how Anderson proved once again that his productions were ahead of their time,S
During the course of the production the creative styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict,S
During one session Parrish refused to follow the shooting script having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot,S
When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities the director announced to the cast and crew Hell you heard the producer,S
If I dont shoot these scenes which I dont really want dont need and will cut out anyway Ill be in breach of contract,S
So what well do is shoot those scenes next,S
In his 2002 biography Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film  that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place,S
Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrishs direction was uninspired,S
We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him,S
One dispute among the founders of Century 21  Gerry and Sylvia Anderson Reg Hill and John Read  emerged from the filming of other scenes including one in which the character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower,S
Read the director of photography had complied with Parrishs instructions to light the sequence in silhouette,S
Anderson who had intended the scene to display fullfrontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl demanded a reshoot insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners,S
Refusing to refilm the scenes on the basis that Parrishs instructions had precedence over Andersons Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons and Hills request,S
Anderson elaborated Clearly John was in a difficult position,S
I do now understand how he must have felt but in my heart I feel he couldnt play a double role,S
Supervising director Derek Meddings oversaw the shooting of more than 200 effects shots including the destruction of EUROSEC Headquarters at the end of the film,S
A sixfoot 18 m Phoenix scale model which emulated the design of the NASA multistage Saturn V rocket had to be rebuilt after unexpectedly igniting and nearly injuring a technician,S
Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as one of the most spectacular of its kind produced by Century 21,S
Sylvia Anderson who considers is indistinguishable from a Cape Kennedy launch comments that she is still impressed by the magic of the effects,S
Technology has come a long way since the early Seventies but Dereks effects have endured,S
Once the original had been incinerated carpenters at Pinewood rebuilt the prop although Anderson remained disappointed with the finished product which he considered inferior,S
The track titled Sleeping Astronauts which accompanies the scenes of Ross and Kanes journey through the Solar System features an Ondes Martenot played by French ondiste Sylvette Allart,S

Herbert Chapman 19 January 1878  6 January 1934 was an English association football player and manager,S
Though he had an undistinguished playing career he went on to become one of the most successful and influential managers in early 20thcentury English football before his sudden death in 1934,S
As a player Chapman played for a variety of clubs at League and nonLeague levels,S
After the war ended City were implicated in an illegal payments scandal and were eventually disbanded,S
Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed and then took over at Huddersfield Town winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the space of four years,S
In 1925 Arsenal successfully tempted Chapman to join them and he brought the previously trophyless club an FA Cup and two First Division titles,S
The most successful of these was his younger brother Harry who played for The Wednesday during the 1900s winning two League Championships and an FA Cup,S
His older brother Tom played for Grimsby Town while another brother Matthew later became a director of the same club,S
He first played as a youth for his local side Kiveton Park Colliery before leaving home in 1895,S
He moved to AshtonunderLyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale not to be confused with the modernday Rochdale AFC,S
all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League,S
Chapman played at inside right and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry he compensated for it with his strength and robustness,S
In 1898 he joined his brother Tom at Second Division Grimsby Town,S
Grimsby started the season poorly  they were near the bottom of the division by Christmas and were beaten 70 by Preston North End in the FA Cup but rallied to finish tenth at the end of 189899,S
He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United who finished bottom of the Southern League in 18991900,S
He played for Northampton for the whole 190102 season finishing as top scorer with 14 goals in 22 games for the club,S
He played 22 matches and scored twice for United but struggled to keep his place in a team full of internationals and was sold to Notts County for 300 at the end of 190203,S
Chapman turned professional again but only made seven appearances in two years for County scoring once,S
In 1904 Chapman moved back to his old club Northampton Town playing a season effectively on loan from Notts County as they kept his registration before being transferred permanently in 1905 to Tottenham Hotspur for 70,S
He spent 190607 in and out of the side scoring just three goals,S
With the season drawing to a close he decided that he had had a good innings and decided to leave Tottenham and professional football for good in favour of pursuing his career in engineering,S
Chapman changed his mind about retiring from the game and instead agreed to become playermanager of Northampton Town,S
Northampton had finished bottom of the Southern League two seasons running immediately before Chapmans appointment but Chapman turned the club around within a short space of time,S
The most that I remember was the occasional chat between say two men playing on the same wing,S
As a manager he sought to change that after seeing Northampton lose to Norwich City despite dominating Chapman opined that a team can attack for too long,S
Chapman was keen to get Northampton Town into the Football League but with no automatic promotion or relegation rules at the time this proved very difficult,S
In the 1912 close season he was offered the chance to manage Second Division Leeds City and with Northamptons blessing moved north again to join the League side,S
Attendances rose at Elland Road from 8500 to 13000 in his first year as Chapmans attacking side scored 70 goals the secondhighest total in the entire division,S
With a strengthening of the defence Citys form improved further the next season in 191314 coming fourth two points outside the promotion places,S
Despite having failed on his promise to get the team promoted within two years Citys rising attendances and resulting better profits for the club kept the directors happy and the club were confident of promotion in 191415,S
Leeds City lost six of their last eight games of the season to finish just fifteenth,S
League football was suspended for the rest of the war with Leeds City playing in regional competitions,S
With many players away fighting or having left the game due to a drop in wages Leeds relied heavily on guest players during these matches,S
Chapman meanwhile had decided to help the war effort by taking up a position as manager of a munitions factory at Barnbow near Cross Gates in 1916,S
For the next two years Citys assistant manager George Cripps stood in for Chapman on the administrative side while chairman Joe Connor and another director took charge of the team,S
Chapman returned to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended but resigned suddenly in December 1918 eventually moving to Selby to take up a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works,S

In July 1958 Lebanon was threatened by a civil war between Maronite Christians and Muslims,S
At the time the United States was engaged in the Cold War,S
Throughout the war most or all militias operated with little regard for human rights and the sectarian character of some battles made noncombatant civilians a frequent target,S
Smuggling During the civil war Lebanon turned into one of the worlds largest narcotics producers with much of the hashish production centered in the Bekaa valley,S
But much else was also smuggled such as guns and supplies all kinds of stolen goods and regular trade  war or no war Lebanon would not give up its role as the middleman in EuropeanArab business,S
Many battles were fought over Lebanons ports to gain smugglers access to the sea routes,S
Still there existed a number of nonreligious groups primarily but not exclusively of the left andor PanArab right,S
Examples of this were the Lebanese Communist Party LCP and the more radical and independent Communist Action Organization COA,S
Another notable example was the panSyrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party SSNP which promoted the concept of Greater Syria in contrast to PanArab or Lebanese nationalism,S
The umbrella organization the Palestine Liberation Organization PLOby itself undoubtedly Lebanons most potent fighting force at the timewas little more than a loose confederation but its leader Yassir Arafat controlled all factions by buying their loyalties,S
The more ideological factions however included Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine PFLP and its splinter the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine DFLP,S
Lesser roles were played by the fractious Palestinian Liberation Front PLF and another splitoff from the PFLP the Syrianaligned Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  General Command PFLPGC,S

Muslim and Palestinian militias retaliated with force increasing the total death count to between 200 and 600 civilians and militiamen,S
After this point allout fighting began between the militias,S
In a vicious spiral of sectarian violence civilians were an easy target,S
On 18 January 1976 about 1000 people were killed by Maronite forces in the Karantina Massacre immediately followed by a retaliatory strike on Damour by Palestinian militias,S
The ethnic and religious layout of the residential areas of the capital encouraged this process and East and West Beirut were increasingly transformed into what was in effect Christian and Muslim Beirut,S
Also the number of Maronite leftists who had allied with the LNM and Muslim conservatives with the government dropped sharply as the war revealed itself as an utterly sectarian conflict,S
Another effect of the massacres was to bring in Yassir Arafats wellarmed Fatah and thereby the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the side of the LNM as Palestinian sentiment was by now completely hostile to the Maronite forces,S
With Damascus supplying arms Maronite forces managed to break through the defenses of the Tel alZaatar refugee camp in East Beirut which had long been under siege,S
A massacre of about 2000 Palestinians followed which unleashed heavy criticism against Syria from the Arab world,S
On 19 October 1976 the Battle of Aishiya took place when a combined force of PLO and a Communist militia attacked Aishiya an isolated Maronite village in a mostly Muslim area,S
The Artillery Corps of the Israel Defense Forces fired 24 shells 66 kilograms of TNT each from USmade 175millimeter field artillery units at the attackers repelling their first attempt,S
However the PLO and Communists returned at night when low visibility made Israeli artillery far less effective,S
Other Arab nations were also part of the ADF but they lost interest relatively soon and Syria was again left in sole control now with the ADF as a diplomatic shield against international criticism,S
The Civil War was officially ended at this point and an uneasy quiet settled over Beirut and most of the rest of Lebanon,S

The main confrontation line in divided Beirut was known as the Green Line,S
In East Beirut in 1976 Maronite leaders of the National Liberal Party NLP the Kataeb Party and the Lebanese Renewal Party joined in the Lebanese Front a political counterpoint to the LNM,S
Their militias  the Tigers Kataeb Regulatory Forces KRF and Guardians of the Cedars  entered a loose coalition known as the Lebanese Forces to form a military wing for the Lebanese Front,S
From the very beginning the Kataeb and its Regulatory Forces militia under the leadership of Bashir Gemayel dominated the LF,S
While Jumblatts role as leader of the Druze Progressive Socialist Party was filled surprisingly smoothly by his son Walid Jumblatt the LNM disintegrated after his death,S
Although the antigovernment pact of leftists Shia Sunni Palestinians and Druze would stick together for some time more their wildly divergent interests tore at opposition unity,S
Sensing the opportunity Hafez alAssad immediately began splitting up both the Maronite and Muslim coalitions in a game of divide and conquer,S
The Israeli Army occupied most of the area south of the Litani River,S
These positions were held by the South Lebanon Army SLA a ChristianShia militia under the leadership of Major Saad Haddad,S

Time evolution is the change of state brought about by the passage of time applicable to systems with internal state also called stateful systems,S
In this formulation time is not required to be a continuous parameter but may be discrete or even finite,S
In classical physics time evolution of a collection of rigid bodies is governed by the principles of classical mechanics,S
In their most rudimentary form these principles express the relationship between forces acting on the bodies and their acceleration given by Newtons laws of motion,S
These principles can also be equivalently expressed more abstractly by Hamiltonian mechanics or Lagrangian mechanics,S
The concept of time evolution may be applicable to other stateful systems as well,S
In this case time is discrete,S
Stateful systems often have dual descriptions in terms of states or in terms of observable values,S
In such systems time evolution can also refer to the change in observable values,S
This is particularly relevant in quantum mechanics where the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture are mostly equivalent descriptions of time evolution,S
The following identity holdsformula_2To see why this is true suppose x  X is the state at time s,S
Then by the definition of F Ft sx is the state of the system at time t and consequently applying the definition once more Fu tFt sx is the state at time u,S
But this is also Fu sx,S
In classical mechanics the propagators are functions that operate on the phase space of a physical system,S
In quantum mechanics the propagators are usually unitary operators on a Hilbert space,S
The asymptotic properties of time evolution are given by the scattering matrix,S

In 1059 the papaldecree of Pope Nicholas II established new rules for the Papal election therefore putting an end to the noblepapacy formula,S
The Battle of Wizna was fought between September 7 and September 10 1939 between the forces of Poland and Germany during the initial stages of Invasion of Poland,S
The spot was chosen carefully most of the concrete bunkers were built on hills overlooking a swampy Narew River valley,S
They could be reached either through direct assault through the swamps or by attack along the causeway leading from the bridge in Wizna,S
Before September 1 1939 only 16 bunkers were built out of 60 planned,S
Four additional heavy bunkers were under construction when World War II started,S
In addition the area was reinforced with trenches antitank and antipersonnel obstacles barbed wire lines and land mines,S
There were also plans to break the dams on the Biebrza and Narew rivers to flood the area but the summer of 1939 was one of the driest seasons in Polish history and the water level was too low,S
Although not all bunkers were ready by the beginning of the war the Polish lines of defence were wellprepared,S
The walls of an average bunker 15 metres thick and reinforced with 20centimetrethick steel plates could withstand a direct hit from even the heaviest guns available to the Wehrmacht at the time,S
The German 3rd Army was to advance from East Prussia towards Warsaw directly through the positions of Polish Narew Corps,S
On September 2 Captain Władysław Raginis was named the commander of the Wizna area,S
As his command post he chose the GG126 bunker near the village of Góra Strękowa,S
His forces numbered approximately 700 soldiers and NCOs and 20 officers armed with 6 pieces of artillery 75mm 24 HMGs 18 machine guns and two Kb ppanc wz35 antitank rifles,S
On September 3 Polish positions were spotted from the air and strafed with machine gun fire from enemy fighters,S
On September 7 1939 the reconnaissance units of the 10th Panzer Division of general Nikolaus von Falkenhorst captured the village of Wizna,S
When German tanks tried to cross the bridge it was blown up by Polish engineers,S
After dark patrols of German infantry crossed the river and advanced towards Giełczyn but were repelled with heavy casualties,S
On September 8 general Heinz Guderian commander of the XIX Panzer Corps was ordered to advance through Wizna towards Brześć,S
By early morning of September 9 his units reached the Wizna area and were joined with 10th Panzer Division and Lötzen Brigade already present in the area,S
Altogether his forces were some 60 times stronger than the Polish defenders,S
In order to strengthen the morale of his troops Władysław Raginis and Lt Brykalski swore that they would not leave their post alive and that resistance would continue,S
The Polish artillery was much weaker and was soon forced to retreat towards Białystok,S
Two platoons defending several bunkers located to the north of Narew were attacked from three sides by German tanks and infantry,S
Initially the losses among German infantry were high but after heavy artillery fire the commander of the Giełczyn area First Lieutenant Kiewlicz was ordered to burn the wooden bridge over Narew and withdraw to Białystok,S
The remnants of his forces broke through the German encirclement and reached Białystok where they joined the forces of general Franciszek Kleeberg,S
However at 6 oclock in the evening the Polish infantry was forced to abandon the trenches and field fortifications and retreat into the bunkers,S
The German tanks could finally cross the Polish lines and advance towards Tykocin and Zambrów,S
Tadeusz Tabaczyński commander of the Osowiec fortified area located some 30 kilometres to the north he could not expect any reinforcements,S
On September 8 the Marshal of Poland Edward ŚmigłyRydz ordered the 135th Infantry Regiment that constituted the reserves of both Osowiec and Wizna to be withdrawn to Warsaw,S
When the order was withdrawn and the unit returned to Osowiec it was already too late to help the isolated Poles at Wizna,S
Heavy fighting for each of the now isolated bunkers continued,S
Several assaults were repelled during the night and in the early morning of September 10,S
At approximately 11 oclock German engineers with the help of tanks and artillery finally managed to destroy all but two of the Polish bunkers,S
Both of them were located in the centre of Strękowa Góra and continued fighting despite having much of the crew wounded or incapacitated and most of their machine guns destroyed,S
After the war the Poles insisted that Heinz Guderian in an attempt to end the Polish resistance threatened the Polish commander that he would shoot the POWs if the remaining forces did not surrender,S
He himself  seriously injured at the time  refused to surrender and committed suicide by throwing himself on a grenade,S
Later it advanced further southwards and took part in the Battle of Brześć,S
The heroic struggle against overwhelming odds is one of the symbols of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 and is a part of Polish popular culture,S

In quantum mechanics the interaction picture also known as the Dirac picture is an intermediate representation between the Schrödinger picture and the Heisenberg picture,S
Whereas in the other two pictures either the state vector or the operators carry time dependence in the interaction picture both carry part of the time dependence of observables,S
Equations that include operators acting at different times which hold in the interaction picture dont necessarily hold in the Schrödinger or the Heisenberg picture,S
This is because timedependent unitary transformations relate operators in one picture to the analogous operators in the others,S
If the Hamiltonian has explicit timedependence for example if the quantum system interacts with an applied external electric field that varies in time it will usually be advantageous to include the explicitly timedependent terms with H1S leaving H0S timeindependent,S
We proceed assuming that this is the case,S
This particular operator then can be called H0 without ambiguity,S
In particular let and be the density matrix in the interaction picture and the Schrödinger picture respectively,S
If there is probability to be in the physical state _ψn thenformula_4Timeevolution equations in the interaction pictureTimeevolution of statesTransforming the Schrödinger equation into the interaction picture givesformula_5This equation is referred to as the SchwingerTomonaga equation,S

However after the Battles of Mława and Wizna the German XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian broke through Polish lines and sped southward with the aim of flanking Warsaw from the East and cutting Poland in two,S
Already on 8 September the German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop notified the Soviet government that the German forces would have to violate the Soviet sphere,S
The ancient fortress of Brześć is at the confluence of Muchawiec and Bug Rivers,S
Occupying the site of a medieval castle it was strengthened and reconstructed in Napoleonic times and then again in 1847,S
Heavily damaged during World War I the fortress was turned into a matériel depot and its central part into a prison,S
Although largely obsolete by contemporary standards the fortress occupied a strategic position in the Polish lines and its defence could prevent German forces from crossing Polesia into Lesser Poland and Galicia to the south,S
The aim of the German XIX Corps was to seize the fortress in order to prevent elements of a divided Independent Operational Group Narew under General MłotFijałkowski from retreating southwards and joining the rest of the Polish forces,S
At the end of the summer the fortress was housing the march battalions of 82nd and 35th infantry regiments and elements of various smaller units,S
Moreover a large number of newly mobilised reservists started to arrive at the fortress awaiting forward deployment to their units,S
From these units General Konstanty Plisowski organized a force of roughly three infantry battalions aided by an engineering battalion several batteries of artillery and two companies of old FT17 tanks used for training Nos,S
The Polish forces consisted of three infantry battalions one engineering battalion some artillery and were assisted by two armoured trains numbers 55  53 commanded by Captains Mieczysław Malinowski and Andrzej Podgórski,S
The German forces consisted of the entire XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian,S
The probe attack was repelled by Polish infantry and the 113th company of light tanks consisting of 12 obsolete Renault FT tanks,S
All the Polish tanks were destroyed but the German forces were forced to retreat towards their initial positions,S
Polish Armoured train number 53 PP53 which made a reconnaissance advance to Wysokie Litewskie was attacked by a scout patrol from the 10th Panzer Division,S
The crew from the train opened fire with artillery,S
Later that day the German artillery arrived and started bombardment of both the fortress and the town,S
At dawn approximately half of the town was in German hands the other half being defended by Polish infantry,S
The following day Polish defenders withdrew from the town but heavy casualties on both sides prevented the German units from continuing the attacks on the fortress,S
When reports told Polish General Plisowski that scout elements from the 3rd Panzer Division were seen near the railway station at Żabinka north of Kobryń he sent PP55 to prevent his forces from being cut off,S
A platoon of 5 scout tanks left the train near Żabinka and attacked German armoured cars near a bridge on Muchawiec River,S
After losing three tanks the other two withdrew,S
A further attack by an assault platoon from the train failed,S
After a combined attack of the assault platoon and PP55 artillery the Germans left the area of the Muchawiec bridge,S
When they returned PP55 attacked another battle group of the 3rd Panzer Division consisting of scout elements and the 5th Tank Regiment supported by the 6th Battery of the 75th light artillery Regiment,S
After destroying a few armoured cars the train withdrew towards Brześć and the train station was left in German hands,S
The main assault finally started in the early morning of 16 September,S
The defenders had plenty of small arms ammunition and light arms thanks to the munitions depot in the fortress but had almost no antitank weapons and insufficient artillery cover,S
Although the German infantry was repelled and the assault of German tanks was stopped by two FT tanks sealing the northern gate of the fortress by nightfall it became apparent that the German pressure made the situation very grave,S
At dawn General Plisowski ordered part of the Polish forces to retreat from the easternmost fortifications and regroup to the other side of the river and southwards,S
The evacuation was completed by early morning 17 September when the last unit crossing the bridge blew it up to hinder the Germans,S
An hour later elements of the German 76th infantry regiment entered the fortress  almost unopposed,S
The only Polish unit to remain in the fortress was the remnants of 82nd Infantry Regiment under Captain Radziszewski who decided to fight to the end,S
During that event a joint GermanSoviet parade was held in the town after which the German forces left the area crossed the Bug River and started their pursuit of the fleeing forces of general Plisowski,S
Some to the east the Polish improvised Kobryń Infantry Division under Colonel Epler was ordered to retreat in tandem with Plisowski,S
After the Battle of Kobryń the division evaded encirclement and joined the forces of General Plisowski,S
Under command of General Franciszek Kleeberg they formed the bulwark of the remaining Polish Army fighting effectively against both the Wehrmacht and Red Army until the Battle of Kock that ended on 6 October 1939,S

They sent many warriors to resist Andrew Jacksons invasion in the Creek War,S
This county was part of the territory ceded by the Creeks in the Treaty of Fort Jackson in 1814,S
The first county seat was at Jacksons Mill but the court only met there long enough to select a permanent seat at Washington built on the former site of Atagi in the southeast corner of the county,S
In 1830 the county seat was moved to a more central location at Kingston and the town of Washington dwindled until it was completely deserted in the late 1830s,S

Louis V was the eldest son of Emperor Louis IV and his first wife Beatrix of Świdnica,S
He was a member of the Wittelsbach dynasty,S
As a consequence of the murder of Provost Nikolaus von Bernau by Berlin citizens in 1325 the town was punished with a papal interdict,S
In order to acquire Tyrol for the Wittelsbach family Louis V married Margarete Maultasch in 1342 before she was divorced from her previous husband John Henry of Luxembourg,S
William of Ockham and Marsilius of Padua defended this first civil marriage in the Middle Ages,S
The Pope however excommunicated the couple and the scandal was known across Europe,S

He managed to keep all possessions for the Wittelsbach dynasty until his death,S
First Louis successfully repulsed an attack of Charles IV against Tyrol in 1347,S

The 196970 NHL season was the 53rd season of the National Hockey League,S
For the third straight season the St Louis Blues reached the Stanley Cup finals and for the third straight year the winners of the expansion Western Division were swept four games to none,S
This time however it was at the hands of the Boston Bruins as the defending champions Montreal Canadiens narrowly missed the playoffs something that would not happen again for the next quarter century,S
With the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens out this meant that all participating teams in the 1970 playoffs were from the United States the only time this has occurred in league history as of 2014,S
It was also the final season that teams wore their colored jerseys at home until the 200304 season,S
He did it by setting a new record for assists with 87 and totalling 120 points only six shy of the point record set the previous season by teammate Phil Esposito,S
Gordie Howe finished the season within the ten leading NHL point scorers for an alltime record of 21 consecutive seasons it was the final season he would do so,S
For the third straight season the St Louis Blues easily won the West Division being the only team in the division to have a winning record,S
The East Division however saw a temporary changing of the guard as Montreal dropped from first the previous season to fifth missing the playoffs on the total goals scored tiebreaker with the New York Rangers,S
The Rangers were in first place for a time but injuries on the blueline doomed any hope of a firstplace finish and they even obtained Tim Horton in desperation,S
These developments were instrumental in the decision to move Chicago to the West Division in conjunction with the 1970 expansion and the adoption of crossover playoff series between East and West Division teams the following season,S
The division crossover kept the newer expansion teams out of the Stanley Cup final for the next three seasons,S
The Bruins and the Black Hawks both tied for the lead in the East with 99 points but Chicago was awarded first place because they had more wins,S
This led to unusual tactics from both teams,S
In their secondlast game the Detroit Red Wings had clinched a playoff spot after having missed the postseason for the past three years,S
Many of their players were jubilant and were wildly celebrating this accomplishment despite the fact that they were scheduled to face New York the next afternoon to finish the season,S
Several Detroit players still had hangovers from last nights party just hours before they took to the ice against the Rangers,S
The desperate Rangers managed 65 shots on Detroit goalie Roger Crozier to amass a 93 lead early in the third period,S
Nonetheless however New York was now equal on points with Montreal and had four more goals for the season,S
That night the Canadiens played against the notably stingy Chicago Black Hawks in what was both teams final regular season game,S
Unlike the Red Wings who had nothing else to accomplish in their final game the Black Hawks were playing for first place in their division,S
But the strategy backfired as Montreal failed to score while Chicago scored five times into the empty Montreal net to win 102,S
The Canadiens ending the season with two goals behind the Rangers were out of the playoffs,S
Angry Habs fans have accused Detroit having already secured a postseason berth and with nowhere to move in the standings of purposely throwing the game to let the Rangers make the playoffs,S
Gerry Cheevers of the Bruins led all goaltenders with twelve wins while Jacques Plante of the Blues led all goaltenders in goals against average in the playoffs with 148,S

Différance is a French term coined by Jacques Derrida deliberately homophonous with the word différence,S
The term was then elaborated in various other works notably in his essay Différance and in various interviews collected in Positions,S
In the essay Différance Derrida indicates that différance gestures at a number of heterogeneous features that govern the production of textual meaning,S
The first relating to deferral is the notion that words and signs can never fully summon forth what they mean but can only be defined through appeal to additional words from which they differ,S
The second relating to difference sometimes referred to as espacement or spacing concerns the force that differentiates elements from one another and in so doing engenders binary oppositions and hierarchies that underpin meaning itself,S
Form of Content which Louis Hjelmslev distinguished from Form of Expression than how the word house may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house ie,S
Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by différance,S
Deferral also comes into play as the words that occur following house or white in any expression will revise the meaning of that word sometimes dramatically so,S
Thus complete meaning is always differential and postponed in language there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total,S

A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet,S
It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate toplevel domain TLD,S
The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating resolving human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts,S
A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol UDP packets resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses,S
The top of that hierarchy is the root domain,S
A resolver breaks the name up into its labels from right to left,S
The first component TLD is queried using a root server to obtain the responsible authoritative server,S
Queries for each label return more specific name servers until a name server returns the answer of the original query,S
In practice most of this information does not change very often over a period of hours and therefore it is cached by intermediate name servers or by a name cache built into the users application,S
A survey in 2003 reports that only 2 of all queries to the root servers were legitimate,S
Incorrect or nonexistent caching was responsible for 75 of the queries 125 were for unknown TLDs 7 were for lookups using IP addresses as if they were domain names etc,S
Some misconfigured desktop computers even tried to update the root server records for the TLDs,S
A similar list of observed problems and recommended fixes has been published in RFC 4697,S
Such servers are synchronized with the official root zone file as published by ICANN and do not constitute an alternate root,S
However the root zone is controlled by the United States Department of Commerce who must approve all changes to the root zone file requested by ICANN,S
This database is used by almost all Internet applications to translate worldwide unique names like wwwwikipediaorg into other identifiers such as IP addresses,S
On 12 December 2004 there were 258 TLDs and 773 different authoritative servers for those TLDs listed,S
Other name servers forward queries for which they do not have any information about authoritative servers to a root name server,S
The root name server using its root zone file answers with a referral to the authoritative servers for the appropriate TLD or with an indication that no such TLD exists,S

AD 126130 was an Empress of Rome and wife to the Roman Emperor Domitian,S
She was the youngest daughter of the general and consul Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo,S
The marriage produced only one son whose early death is believed to have been the cause of temporary rift between Domitia and her husband in 83,S
She became Empress of Rome upon Domitians accession in 81 and remained so until his assassination in 96,S
She is believed to have died sometime between 126 and 130,S
Domitias father Corbulo had been one of Romes most respected Senators and generals serving as consul under Caligula and conducting military campaigns in Germania and Parthia under Claudius and Nero,S
Following the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Emperor Nero in 65 however Corbulo was disgraced when his family was brought in connection to the conspirators,S
The crisis came to an end with the accession of Vespasian who reestablished peace in the Empire and founded the shortlived Flavian dynasty,S
In 71 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son Domitian and the daughter of his eldest son Titus Julia Flavia,S
By this time however Domitian had already met and fallen in love with Domitia Longina and managed to persuade Lamia to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself,S
Despite its initial recklessness the alliance was very prestigious for both families,S
In the same year Domitia and Domitians only attested son was born,S
It is not known what the boys name was but he died in childhood in 83,S
After barely two years in office Titus unexpectedly died of brain fever on 13 September 81,S
His last words were reported to have been I have made but one mistake,S
The contemporary historian Suetonius speculated on the possible involvement of Domitian in his brothers death attributing his final words to a popular rumour of the time which held that Titus had carried on an affair with Domitia Longina,S
However even he dismisses the story as highly unlikely,S
On 14 September the Roman Senate confirmed Domitian as Titus successor granting tribunician power the office of Pontifex Maximus and the titles of Augustus and Pater Patriae,S
Consequently Domitia Longina became Empress of Rome,S
Both appeared on Domitians coinage during this time,S
Nevertheless the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83,S
According to Suetonius Domitia was exiled because of an affair with a famous actor named Paris,S
When Domitian found out he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife,S
Modern historians consider this highly implausible however noting that many of these stories were propagated by hostile senatorial authors who condemned Domitian as a tyrant after his death,S
In 93 a son of Helvidius Priscus was executed for having composed a farce satirizing Domitians separation from his wife,S
By 84 Domitia had returned to the palace where she lived for the remainder of Domitians reign without incident,S
Little is known of Domitias precise activities as Empress or how much influence she wielded in Domitians government but it seems her role was largely limited to ceremonial appearances,S
His body was carried away on a common bier and unceremoniously cremated by his nurse Phyllis who mingled the ashes with those of his niece Julia at the Flavian temple,S
The same day he was succeeded by his friend and advisor Marcus Cocceius Nerva,S
Ancient sources have implicated Domitia in the conspiracy against Domitian either by direct involvement or advance awareness of the assassination,S
The historian Cassius Dio writing more than a century after the assassination claimed that Domitia chanced upon a list of courtiers Domitian intended to put to death and passed the information to his chamberlain Parthenius,S
According to Jones the evidence suggests that Domitia remained devoted to Domitian even after his death,S

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is the home video distribution arm of Sony Pictures Entertainment a subsidiary of Sony Corporation,S
Those who could afford such luxuries could buy a 16 mm or 8 mm film projector and rent or buy homeuse prints of some cartoons short comedies and brief highlights reels edited from feature films,S
In the case of the 16 mm format most of these were available with an optical soundtrack and even some entire feature films in 16 mm could be rented or at a steep price bought,S
8 mm films almost never ran longer than ten minutes and only a few were available with a magnetic soundtrack late in the life of the format the rest were silent,S
The Super 8 film format introduced in 1965 was marketed for making home movies but it also boosted the popularity of showathome films,S
Eventually longer and longer editeddown versions of feature films were issued increasingly with a magnetic soundtrack and in color but they were quite expensive and served only a small niche market of very dedicated or affluent film lovers,S
The Betamax and VHS home videocassette formats were not introduced until 1975 and 1976 respectively and it took several years and substantial price drops before they started to become a widespread household fixture,S

Prices were therefore set very high,S

After the war he became a journalist and author as well as earning an income from investments,S
In 1952 Weyl testified before the Senate Internal Security Committee that he had been a member of the Ware group and that Alger Hiss had attended meetings as well,S
This was the only eyewitness corroboration of Whittaker Chamberss testimony that Alger Hiss was a Communist,S
However it came two years after Hiss had been convicted of perjury and Weyls failure to come forward as a witness in the Hiss trials was never explained by Weyl,S
Weyl writings included studies of communism especially in Latin America espionage and internal security in the United States racial ethnic and class analyses of societies and the roles of political and intellectual elites,S
Some of his writing has been published in eugenics journals and has espoused such views as blaming modern revolutionary movements on the envy of nonachievers against creative minorities,S

The relation between anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche has been ambiguous,S
For Sunshine The list is not limited to culturallyoriented anarchists such as Emma Goldman who gave dozens of lectures about Nietzsche and baptized him as an honorary anarchist,S
Also in european individualist anarchist circles his influence is clear in thinkeractivists such as Emile Armand and Renzo Novatore among others,S
Also more recently in postleft anarchy Nietzsche is present in the thought of Albert Camus Hakim Bey Michel Onfray and Wolfi Landstreicher,S
The ideas of 19thcentury German philosophers Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche have often been compared and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings sometimes raising the question of influence,S
In Germany during the early years of Nietzsches emergence as a wellknown figure the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Schopenhauer,S
However there is no irrefutable indication that he actually read it as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsches publications papers or correspondence,S
And yet as soon as Nietzsches work began to reach a wider audience the question of whether or not he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised,S
As early as 1891 while Nietzsche was still alive though incapacitated by mental illness Eduard von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner,S
The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy,S
Nevertheless from the very beginning of what was characterized as great debate regarding Stirners possible influence on Nietzsche  positive or negative  serious problems with the idea were noted,S
By the middle of the 20th century if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable,S
But the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority perhaps because it seems necessary to explain in some reasonable fashion the oftennoted though arguably superficial similarities in their writings,S
In any case the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other,S
They also consist in establishing precisely how and why Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche,S
One researcher notes Indeed translations of Nietzsches writings in the United States very likely appeared first in Liberty the anarchist journal edited by Benjamin Tucker,S
He adds Tucker preferred the strategy of exploiting his writings but proceeding with due caution Nietzsche says splendid things  often indeed Anarchist things  but he is no Anarchist,S
It is of the Anarchists then to intellectually exploit this wouldbe exploiter,S
They establishedaffinity groups that in 1912 came to according to Max Nettlau to the number of 20,S
Vicente Rojas Lizcano whose pseudonym was Biófilo Panclasta was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist,S
In 1904 he begins using the name Biofilo Panclasta,S
Biofilo in Spanish stands for lover of life and Panclasta for enemy of all,S
He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietszche,S
Rocker even ends his book with a Nietzsche quote,S
The idea that all political and social events are but the result of given economic conditions and can be explained by them cannot endure careful consideration,S
Rocker also translated Thus Spoke Zarathustra into Yiddish,S
Murray Bookchin in The Spanish Anarchists describes prominent CNTFAI member Salvador Seguí as an admirer of Nietzschean individualism of the superhombre to whom all is permitted,S
Bookchin in his 1973 introduction to Sam Dolgoffs The Anarchist Collectives even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project,S
Alan Antliff documents in I Am Not A Man I Am Dynamite how the Indian art critic and antiimperialist Ananda Coomaraswamy combined Nietzsches individualism and sense of spiritual renewal with both Kropotkins economics and with Asian idealist religious thought,S
This combination was offered as a basis for the opposition to British colonization as well as to industrialization,S
This is the case of Emma Goldman and Federica Montseny,S
In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist and all true anarchists were aristocrats I said and In Vienna one could hear interesting lectures on modern German prose and poetry,S
Also Camus is known as an ardent critic of marxism and marxists regimes and aligned himself with anarchism while also being a critic of modern capitalist society and fascism,S
The influence of Nietzsche on Camus is well known and as such the essay The Rebel presents an anarchist view on politics influenced as much as by Nietzsche as by Max Stirner who are treated in that book,S
Like Nietzsche he maintains a special admiration for Greek heroic values and pessimism for classical virtues like courage and honor,S
What might be termed Romantic values also merit particular esteem within his philosophy passion absorption in being sensory experience the glory of the moment the beauty of the world,S
The general secretary of the Fédération Anarchiste Georges Fontenis also reviewed Camuss book The Rebel in Le Libertaire,S
Fontenis replied that it was,S

One of the most curious features of the second apocalypse of James is that this range of dating of its original text assigned to it by scholars requires that it was written before the First Apocalypse of James,S
There are a number of differences with the more canonical history that the text describes,S
For example it names James father Theudas rather than Joseph who is presented as the biological father of James by the mid 2nd century Protevangelium of James,S
The First Apocalypse of James explicitly claims that James and Jesus are not biological brothers,S
However the text also describes how such a kiss was a metaphor for the passing of gnosis explaining the references to it elsewhere making it clear that this isnt the homosexual relationship it appears to be,S

Their product was a collection of 16 books containing more than 2500 constitutions issued between 313 and 437,S
The code covers political socioeconomic cultural and religious subjects of the 4th and 5th century in the Roman Empire,S
Theodosius desired to create a code that would provide much greater insight into law during the later Empire 321429,S
According to Peter Stein Theodosius was perturbed at the low state of legal skill in his empire of the East,S
In 429 he assigned a commission to collect all imperial constitutions since the time of Constantine,S
During the process of gathering the vast amount of material often editors would have multiple copies of the same law,S
Clifford Ando notes that according to Matthews the editors displayed a reliance on western provincial sources through the late 4th century and on central eastern archives thereafter,S
After six years an initial version was finished in 435 but it was not published instead it was improved upon and expanded and finally finished in 438 and taken to the Senate in Rome and Constantinople,S
Matthews believes that the two attempts are not a result of a failed first attempt but instead the second attempt shows reiteration and refinement of the original goals at a new stage in the editorial process,S
Others have put forth alternate theories to explain the lengthy editorial process and two different commissions,S
It was also concerned with the imposition of orthodoxy  the Arian controversy was ongoing  within the Christian religion and contains 65 decrees directed at heretics,S
